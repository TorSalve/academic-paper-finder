    <meta name="dc.description" content="The paper suggests that virtual worlds (VWs) have many unique advantages for supporting interaction design studio activities, provided that they are designed to include appropriate workplaces and interactive tools to foster collaboration and creativity. We present an approach for employing VWs that proposes the use of prospective tools and workplaces throughout the following key activities of interaction design studio courses: design brief, design thinking, design practice (conceptual and detailed), the desk crit, design review and user evaluation. Then, we describe a blended interaction design studio course on the basis of this approach, which ran through a whole semester. We found that the VW design studio is an engaging and constructive experience for students: In the VW environment, students and tutors held many online meetings, and students constructed several models about their design project, developed a digital prototype and conducted a remote usability evaluation. In addition, the persistence of the environment and the developed VW tools helped students and tutors to achieve careful feedback and reflection during the design project lifetime. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain for wider implementation: the refinement of the instructional design approach, the usability of VW tools, further integration of VWs to professional design tools and the conduction of other full-scale VW design studio courses."/>

We present an approach for employing VWs that proposes the use of prospective tools and workplaces throughout the following key activities of interaction design studio courses: design brief, design thinking, design practice (conceptual and detailed), the desk crit, design review and user evaluation. Then, we describe a blended interaction design studio course on the basis of this approach, which ran through a whole semester. We found that the VW design studio is an engaging and constructive experience for students: In the VW environment, students and tutors held many online meetings, and students constructed several models about their design project, developed a digital prototype and conducted a remote usability evaluation. In addition, the persistence of the environment and the developed VW tools helped students and tutors to achieve careful feedback and reflection during the design project lifetime. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain for wider implementation: the refinement of the instructional design approach, the usability of VW tools, further integration of VWs to professional design tools and the conduction of other full-scale VW design studio courses.</p></div></div></section>

The design studio is widely conceived as both (Broadfoot and Bennett <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Broadfoot O, Bennett R (2003) Design studios online?: comparing traditional face-to-face design studio education with modern internet-based design studios.

The design studio place contains spaces, tools and materials for design, arranged informally according to the designers’ convenience. Learning in the design studio emphasizes simple but powerful creative thinking methods that boost creativity, as well as sketching, low-fidelity prototyping and modeling to help idea expression and exchange.</p><p>The design studio is adopted as a teaching approach for interaction design (e.g., Greenberg <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Greenberg S (2009) Embedding a design studio course in a conventional computer science program.

However, it is rapidly evolving as “<i>the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services</i>” (Cooper et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Cooper A, Reimann R, Cronin D (2007) About Face 3: the essentials of interaction design.

The outcome of interaction design is a digital artifact of some sort, which is constructed by quite different materials and mediated by quite different tools, in comparison with other design disciplines. In interaction design there is clearly a number of intangible qualities that affect the design of the digital artifact, for example, services, software and user experiences, which are interleaved with the tangible aspects (Lowgren and Stolterman <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Lowgren J, Stolterman E (2004) Thoughtful interaction design: a design perspective on information technology, MIT Press" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR32" id="ref-link-section-d24591e322">2004</a>). Therefore, teaching and learning interaction design in a design studio has to address several shortcomings of the traditional approach, including:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>In a traditional design studio, students produce paper prototypes and rough mock-ups. It is hard to demonstrate and evaluate the functionality and interaction qualities of digital artifacts as well as to present and simulate usage scenarios in realistic contexts that are required for interaction design.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The collaboration of student groups in the traditional design studio is constrained by space and time arrangements.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Tutors in a traditional design studio need to devote a large amount of time with each student or group to track down their progress. It is hard to be aware of individual student effort for each group work.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>It is difficult for tutors to collaborate remotely with groups. Thus, support is limited to course hours.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <p>These shortcomings highlight the need for platforms that support studio-based learning online to allow for time flexibility, compensate for geographic constraints and support simulation and computational activities that are difficult to conduct in the traditional environment.</p><p>Virtual worlds (VWs) combine a number of characteristics that may be valuable for addressing the identified issues. Concepts and ideas can be visualized and manipulated in real time, users can meet and collaborate in shared workplaces, there is an increased awareness of the work in progress and of user activities, the designed product or system can be presented in a realistic context and evaluated by team members or external users, and some functional aspects can be included in the prototype, for example, moving or rotating parts, inter-object communication and point-and-click user interaction. Additionally, VWs have become nowadays more robust and widely accessible compared to earlier approaches in the past decades, especially due to the constant increase in graphics cards performance and network bandwidth. Second Life, which is today’s most popular general-purpose VW, is already being used extensively for educational (De Lucia et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="De Lucia A, Francese R, Passero I, Tortora G (2009) Development and evaluation of a virtual campus on second life: the case of SecondDMI. Comput Educ 52(1):220–233" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR15" id="ref-link-section-d24591e353">2009</a>) and collaborative design (Chase <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Chase S (2008) Virtual worlds as collaborative environments for design and manufacturing: from idea to product. In: Proceedings of 5th INTUITION international conference" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR9" id="ref-link-section-d24591e356">2008</a>) purposes. However, in the majority of the educational uses of Second Life, traditional classroom activities are simply reproduced in the VW, without taking full advantage of its simulation and real-time interaction affordances. Furthermore, collaborative design approaches using Second Life mostly focus on coconstruction of designed spaces leaving out other important phases and activities of the design process.</p><p>Virtual worlds are general-purpose platforms that provide several affordances and an infrastructure that can enable the creation of digital places for learning and design. This certainly requires not only a re-creation of the physical environment but includes the orchestration of specific activities in the VW, the design of workplaces and tools that mediate these particular learning and design activities in the VW and the pragmatic and full-time application of these in respective courses. The paper identifies an approach for using VWs for the support of teaching and learning at an interaction design studio and presents its application at a blended postgraduate course that ran through a whole semester. The proposed approach identifies prospective VW workspaces and tools for typical phases of the design studio like the design brief, design thinking, design practice (conceptual and detailed), the desk crit, design review and user evaluation. The blended studio made use of the VW in every session following the proposed approach: In the VW environment, students and tutors held many online meetings, and students constructed several models about their design project, developed a digital prototype and conducted a remote usability evaluation. We found that the VW design studio is an engaging and constructive experience for students, however, a number of challenges remain for wider implementation.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Uses of virtual worlds related to design education</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><p>Virtual worlds have already been successfully employed as educational environments in various disciplines. An extensive review on the uses of VWs for learning can be found in Hew and Cheung (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Hew KF, Cheung WS (2010) Use of three-dimensional (3-D) immersive virtual worlds in K-12 and higher education settings: a review of the research.

Nowadays, the popular world of Second Life is being used by schools and universities as a complementary educational place in which the learning community can meet and collaborate. This is not surprising, as VWs have a number of affordances for learning. According to Dalgarno and Lee (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Dalgarno B, Lee MJW (2010) What are the learning affordances of 3-D virtual environments?

Additionally, a number of researchers (Dede <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Dede C (1995) The evolution of constructivist learning environments: immersion in distributed, virtual worlds.

Avatar-based representations, synchronous and asynchronous means of collaboration and enhanced social and workspace awareness are some of their features that can be exploited by collaborating communities. A number of Collaborative Virtual Environments (Benford et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Benford S, Greenhalgh C, Rodden T, Pycock J (2001) Collaborative virtual environments.

Commun ACM 44(12):40–43" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR35" id="ref-link-section-d24591e388">2001</a>). However, the high cost of immersive VR hardware and the lack of adaptability and extensibility of application-specific solutions raised the need for more generic and widely accessible platforms for collaboration in 3D. Nowadays, the use of general-purpose VWs, such as Second Life, ActiveWorlds or OpenSimulator, has emerged as a more preferable solution to design collaboration.</p><p>The concept of using VWs for collaborative design has been proposed by Maher and Simoff (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Maher ML, Simoff SJ (1999) Variations on the virtual design studio. In: Proceedings of fourth international workshop on CSCW in design, Universite de Technologie de Compiegne, pp 159–165" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR33" id="ref-link-section-d24591e394">1999</a>). They describe “virtual studios” as VW models that create a sense of place and are presented like physical design studios. These places may include tools that designers are familiar with and allow them to perform appropriate design activities. The authors further present the approach of “designing within the design,” that is, the design studio being the model of the product or place being designed. This approach has the advantages that designers use a single integrated environment for both private and collaborative activities, that they may visually explore the design while being designed and that they may get immediate feedback from their actions leading to further reflection.</p><p>The affordances of VWs as a tool for collaborative design have been further explored by numerous researchers. Ehsani and Chase (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Ehsani E, Chase SC (2009) Using virtual worlds as collaborative environments for innovation and design: lessons learned and observations from case studies in architectural projects.

In another study, Koutsabasis et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2012" title="Koutsabasis P, Vosinakis S, Malisova K, Paparounas N (2012) On the value of virtual worlds for collaborative design.

The results indicate that VWs can effectively support conceptual design activities and can also be employed for review and customer-centered evaluation of conceptual design.</p><p>There are also a number of studies that explore the use of VWs in specific activities of the design process such as scenario-based design, prototyping and evaluation. Bardzell et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Bardzell J, Bardzell S, Briggs C, Makice K, Ryan W, Weldon M (2006) Machinima prototyping: an approach to evaluation.

Machinima is a technique for simple and fast video production by recording the activity within VWs, which is quite popular nowadays. It can be used in an interaction design studio as a method of scenario-based design alternative to storyboarding in paper. It can be easily performed if the concept is already present in some visual form in the world, it does not require sketching skills, and the results may have better quality.</p><p>Kim et al.

Similarly, a VW has been used for the visualization and evaluation of user interfaces as part of a user interface design model (Vanderdonckt et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Vanderdonckt J, Chieu CK, Bouillon L, Trevisan D (2004) Model-based design, generation, and evaluation of virtual user interfaces.

Finally, VWs have been used as a simulation framework to test and evaluate sensor-based systems (Prendinger et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Prendinger H, Brandherm B, Ullrich S (2009) A simulation framework for sensor-based systems in second life.

The ability to construct and test functional prototypes is a critical requirement of interaction design studios, as the focus of interaction design is not only on the structure and interface of the designed system, but also on the user experience of interacting with it. Given their ability to display functional prototypes placed in realistic concepts, VWs have been applied for user evaluations as well. Second Life has been used as a platform for presenting innovative products and services to the user community and for receiving comments and feedback (Kohler et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Kohler T, Matzler K, Füller J (2009) Avatar-based innovation: using virtual worlds for real-world innovation.

The system presented by Bowman et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Bowman DA, Wineman J, Hodges LF, Allison D (1998) Designing animal habitats within an immersive VE.

Students can modify features such as terrain, visitor viewpoints and visual elements while being immersed in the environment. It is intended to help inexperienced students apply the theories they learned in a realistic problem context. Unfortunately, approaches based on immersive VR systems failed to reach wide audiences due to their high cost and to usability and health problems related to the respective hardware. It took almost a decade after Bowman’s system until Desktop VR solutions were mature enough to be used in formal educational settings. Gul et al.

The project involved the design of two virtual places (a home page and a 3D place in the VW) using a shared whiteboard and the VW.</p><p>The aforementioned studies focused on specific aspects of educational, collaborative and design activities in VWs that were explicitly or implicitly related to interaction design education. However, there is still a lack of paradigms of long-term use of VWs as an educational platform to support all (or at least most of) the student activities found in design studio courses. The focus of our work is to propose such an integrated approach for using VWs as a learning platform for interaction design studio courses.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">Enhancing interaction design studio activities with virtual worlds</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><p>Learning in the design studio incorporates a number of unique activities that have been extensively discussed in related bibliography: the design brief, the desk crit, the interplay of design thinking and practice and the design review. The design brief signifies the beginning of the design process, and it is often a short but solid description of the design project or problem after communication with the client (Ryd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Ryd N (2004) The design brief as carrier of client information during the construction process.

The “desk crit” (Schön <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1987" title="Schön D (1987) Educating the reflective practitioner.

Design thinking refers to the processes of thoughtful idea generation and exchange and includes various methods for organizing personal or group work (Cross et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Cross N, Christiaans H, Dorst K (eds) (1996) Analysing design activity.

Design practice refers to the acts of putting the design into form and function with various materials ranging from paper and pencil to computer-aided design (CAD) and prototyping systems. The design review (or jury) refers to the scrutinizing of student work by the tutor (or sometimes other students as well) (Shaffer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Shaffer DW (2003) Portrait of the Oxford design studio: An ethnography of design pedagogy (WCER Working Paper No. 2003-11).

First, they can minimize geographic and time constraints by allowing remote design participants to meet in the digital studio and progress on collaborative design work, synchronously and/or asynchronously. Second, VWs may provide enhancements to some of the traditional design studio methods and tools in order to allow design participants to reach design proposals more effectively. Last but not least, VWs can be employed in the context of new methods and tools that mediate design processes and that can be proposed to perform design activity. In this section, we discuss the ways by which the virtual world design studio can enhance the aforementioned characteristics of the interaction design course; an outline of these prospective activities, tools and workplaces is also depicted in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Tab1">1</a>.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Overview of prospective activities, methods, tools and workplaces of a virtual world design studio</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/tables/1"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
              <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">The design brief: researching, communicating and documenting the design problem in the virtual world</h3><p>The interaction design studio starts with the “design brief”: This is a written description of the project that is developed in concert between the client and the designer, and its form and length can vary depending on the project scale (Ryd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Ryd N (2004) The design brief as carrier of client information during the construction process. Des Stud 25(3):231–249" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR37" id="ref-link-section-d24591e785">2004</a>). For interaction design learning, the design brief is initially a rather short presentation of an open-ended project or problem that neither can be addressed by a clear-cut approach or method, nor it has a unique “solution.” Depending on the educational approach, the design brief may have to be further developed by students themselves during design research, to identify and include fundamental guidelines and constraints that stem out of client wants and requirements. Typical methods for researching and communicating the design brief among tutors, students and clients include the following: interviews of the client and users, research on competitive products and related technology and feasibility assessment mainly with respect to budget and the design team “know-how.”</p><p>During the design brief activity, the VW may be used in a number of different ways. An initial action would be to post the design brief as a document in a virtual board and to attempt to identify and clarify the critical points and to organize the next actions using synchronous (e.g., in-world meetings) and asynchronous (e.g., comments and interpretations of the design brief) means. In addition, 3D models of buildings, machines and furniture can be built in the VW at the beginning of the project to illustrate the real-world setting for which the design activity will occur, especially if these places are not easy to visit for design teams in the first place—for example, for the design of an information kiosk or a large display to be placed in a public place like an airport or a stadium. Last but not least, synchronous conferencing functionality of VWs can be exploited to host initial meetings with clients. Certainly, these uses of VWs should be complementary to the physical meetings in which nonverbal and contextual cues [like (Dix et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Dix A, Finlay JE, Abowd GD, Beale R (2003) Human-computer interaction, 2nd edn. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d24591e791">2003</a>) eye contact and gaze, gestures and body language, back channels, confirmation and interruption exclamations] help participants to frame their contribution and develop a wider understanding of their involvement. Therefore, VWs can be useful at the design brief phase in order to help the design team keep track of the main issues, comments and questions about the main goals of the design; in some circumstances VWs may also be employed for the building of 3D models about the physical place, where the designed artifacts and/or services will be introduced.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Design research in the virtual world design studio</h3><p>Design research refers to processes of information gathering, documentation and modeling about the domain, the client requirements, other related design artifacts and technology and the context of application. Despite the fact that interaction design is a relatively new discipline, there is a wealth of methods for design research that build and extend the corpus of related work mainly in the neighboring fields of human–computer interaction (HCI) and product design. Typical interaction design research methods include interviewing (and related strategies; Saffer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Saffer D (2007) Designing for interaction.

However, most methods also require some knowledge modeling to record research data and stimulate discussions for design (next phase of the work). In the VW, students can create 3D models that reflect their understanding during their design research, provided they are given interactive tools that can help them develop these models. For this modeling phase, a number of (mostly) 2D design tools are used, and therefore, these can be integrated with a VW to allow discussions with design participants. The VW design studio can host digital work places where models about knowledge gained through design research are created by design teams for discussion and refinement, as well as for future reference. In the later phases, designers will need to have quick access to the large number of related resources collected and constructed during design research, and therefore, a virtual place can help them collaboratively organize the material, in similar ways like those at a physical design studio, for example, a digital mood board posted at a wall of the virtual workplace and a flow chart drawn at an interactive whiteboard. Furthermore, this collection of project material in a single space may also offer tutors a deeper awareness of team progress and individual student contribution, and a chance to provide feedback when needed. All models are created in the VW, they are stored in the VW database, and students can copy them to their personal inventory and organize them in folders for easier access at later stages.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Design thinking in the virtual world design studio</h3><p>Design thinking generally refers to the processes and methods about exploring the design space, investigating ideas about potential design artifacts and identifying and analyzing design options. Design thinking is characterized as the key ability of professional designers, who have developed “<i>at a high degree the skills of resolving ill</i>-<i>defined problems, adopting solution</i>-<i>focused cognitive strategies, employing abductive or appositional thinking and using non</i>-<i>verbal modeling</i>” (Cross <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Cross N (1990) The nature and nurture of design ability. Des Stud 11(3):127–140" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR11" id="ref-link-section-d24591e844">1990</a>). A number of methods facilitate designing thinking in interaction design including brainstorming (Cross <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Cross N (2000) Engineering design methods: strategies for product design, 3rd Ed, Wiley" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR12" id="ref-link-section-d24591e848">2000</a>), scenario-based design (Rosson and Carroll <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Rosson MB, Carroll J (2001) Usability engineering: scenario-based development of human computer interaction, 1st edn. Morgan Kaufmann" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR36" id="ref-link-section-d24591e851">2001</a>) and interpretation sessions (Beyer and Hortzblatt <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Beyer H, Hortzblatt K (1997) Contextual design: defining customer-centered systems (1st ed) Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d24591e854">1997</a>). These methods are often applied in design studio sessions, where students discuss the findings from their design research to identify potential abstract solutions to the problem.</p><p>Design thinking methods may also take place within the VW with the obvious practical advantage of affording remote collaboration at a shared space. Furthermore, with the use of appropriate interactive tools, such as presentation devices, annotations, message and sketch boards and recording devices, students may present their findings to the rest of the group by displaying images or whole presentations in the world, record discussion logs for later reflection, instantly sketch on shared boards to present their ideas and highlight some important conclusions of their discussions. The use of a single workplace in the VW for storing resources, executing activities and producing the results of these activities is valuable both for later use in the creative phases and for progress tracking and feedback. For example, a brainstorming session can be held in the VW following the steps proposed by (Cross <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Cross N (2000) Engineering design methods: strategies for product design, 3rd Ed, Wiley" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR12" id="ref-link-section-d24591e860">2000</a>) as follows: (a) All members of the design team are presented with the goals of the design in terms of short statements formulated after design research; (b) each member writes down design ideas; (c) each member briefly presents their ideas with no critique allowed, while other members try to encompass elements to their ideas; (d) ideas are refined individually again; and (e) second presentations of refined ideas are now processed by senior members of the team to a coherent set of ideas and design guidelines. The use of a VW can add value to this process in several dimensions: Digital workspace is unlimited in comparison with a physical studio space; avatars can explore and inspect models and sketches more easily (e.g., magnify and view from different angles) in comparison with paper sketching or a 2D display; and asynchronous review of notes and models can also take place to allow for reflection and careful feedback.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Design practice in the virtual world design studio</h3><p>Design practice is often distinguished between conceptual design, that is, expressing the fundamental ideas and requirements (Wang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Wang L, Shen W, Xie H, Neelamkavil J, Pardasani A (2002) Collaborative conceptual design—state of the art and future trends.

Various methods have been proposed in interaction design textbooks (Garrett <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Garrett JJ (2003) The elements of user experience.

Detailed design typically involves the construction of the form and function of the user interface through paper sketches to wireframes and screen designs as well as various prototyping methods based on media like paper, video and the web.</p><p>In the traditional design studio, the typical tools for practicing design are the paper and pencil, which allow sketching and modeling for visually expressing ideas about form, function and structure. Sketching and modeling also invites others to provide comments and questions that can be easily altered or improved with paper and pencil or other cheap materials. In interaction design, paper prototyping strategies are also employed in a similar vein (Snyder <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Snyder C (2003) Paper prototyping. Morgan Kauffman" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR41" id="ref-link-section-d24591e889">2003</a>). The typical tools for modern detailed interaction design include web prototyping tools, CAD programs and Integrated (Software) Development Environments (IDEs).</p><p>Conceptual design is probably the activity that VWs have the most potential to support and improve (Koutsabasis et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2012" title="Koutsabasis P, Vosinakis S, Malisova K, Paparounas N (2012) On the value of virtual worlds for collaborative design. Des Stud 33(4):357–390" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR31" id="ref-link-section-d24591e895">2012</a>). A realistic, digital place may be created in the world to represent the problem context, and avatar-based scenarios may be easily explored by the design team. These scenarios may also be recorded using machinima techniques to be further communicated. Students may import material that they prepared outside the VW, such as images and sketches of concepts, or they may collaboratively construct simple 3D forms of their proposed concepts. VWs such as Second Life and OpenSimulator include embedded tools for creating content. Users can construct complex objects by grouping and transforming primitive shapes using a visual interface while being immersed in the VW. These tools are easy to use and do not require advanced 3D modeling skills and are, therefore, suitable for inexperienced students. The VW can be then used as a space in which students visually present their ideas in a design workplace, construct rough forms of solutions in realistically presented places and test various usage scenarios. This rich visual expression of the team’s ideas and progress can be a subject of critique and argumentation by the team members themselves and also by tutors and fellow students, and this ability may lead to improved, refined concepts. Given that both the results of the design thinking processes and the conceptual designs are collocated in a single visual space, students can easily be asked to justify their design solutions based on the research outcomes, to present the paradigms they were based on and to compare them with alternative choices. Thus, the use of a VW as a place of collecting rich data about the design problem and its possible solutions that can be argued upon may also assist students toward following more systematic approaches for exploring the design space and communicating and justifying their solution.</p><p>Furthermore, an interactive product or system prototype that has been designed in detail can be presented inside the VW. Rich 3D graphics using advanced texturing and lighting techniques, such as environmental effects, bump maps, shaders and real-time shadows, can be used to improve the visual appearance of the designed artifact or place. For example, one can create realistic landscapes, define the time of day, which affects the look and lighting of the environment, select and apply appropriate materials on objects, create custom effects using particle animation and define light sources that cast shadows. Additionally, simulation techniques may be used to simulate part of a designed object’s functionality. The extent to which detailed design processes may take place within the VW depends on the ability to easily build 3D models within it and to define their behavior. Given that students of interaction design studio courses do not necessarily have a programming background, the use of pre-constructed simulation objects as building blocks for the interactive behavior of their designed artifact would offer significant assistance. Finally, depending on the nature of the design, the solution may be presented in the VW at different scales. A real-scale (based on the avatar size) solution would be easier to include in avatar-based scenarios and to evaluate it, but in cases of small-sized products or large places, the use of larger or smaller scales would be more appropriate to have a good overview of the design solution.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8">The desk crit: tutor–student interaction in the virtual world</h3><p>The desk crit (Schön <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1987" title="Schön D (1987) Educating the reflective practitioner. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR39" id="ref-link-section-d24591e908">1987</a>) is the intense but loosely structured interaction between the tutor and the student at the time of student design work in the design studio. This interaction is crucial for students’ learning since they are confronted with explaining the rationale for their design decisions to the tutor, who is constantly challenging their thinking and practice. According to Schön (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1987" title="Schön D (1987) Educating the reflective practitioner. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR39" id="ref-link-section-d24591e911">1987</a>), the desk crit is central to the development of a student’s ability to design thoughtfully. The desk crit is a powerful method of studio-based learning; however, a number of challenges remain: The process of design criticism is stressful for learners and entails the danger of excessive subjectivity from tutors (Frederickson and Anderton <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Frederickson MP, Anderton F (1990) Design juries: a study on lines of communication. J Archit Educ 43:22–28" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR19" id="ref-link-section-d24591e914">1990</a>); students have to carefully keep track of comments, corrections and questions and follow-up; the process may take too long and it is mentally demanding for the tutor when he has to oversee many students. According to Goldschmidt et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Goldschmidt G, Hochman H, Dafni I (2010) The design studio “crit”: teacher–student communication. Artif Intell Eng Des Anal Manuf 24(3):285–302" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR22" id="ref-link-section-d24591e917">2010</a>), desk crits are “<i>sensitive and sometimes even charged settings, and teachers must exert much care to ensure their effectiveness as a learning opportunity for students.</i>”</p><p>A VW desk crit session would require the tutor and the student to meet inside the VW design studio to discuss about student work. The student can exhibit the current state of his work in various models including sketches, personas, concept models, flow charts, 3D models and so on, while the tutor can review these and pose questions and make comments in real time. Students can keep track of these questions and comments with interactive VW tools like note cards, annotations, chat recorders and so on. Some of these tools are already built-in in most VW environments, while others have to be developed and incorporated.</p><p>To address the challenges of the desk crit outlined above, the desk crit activity within a VW might also take place asynchronously, especially for the reasons of necessity, when the available time does not allow for a thorough discussion between student and tutor. Tutors can review the progress and the deliverables of student groups by exploring their design workplaces and observing their posted documents, images and structures, to allow for a more careful feedback. Compared to a desk crit activity in the classroom, tutors have more time to review the outcomes and they are better aware of individual student effort. Their comments may be placed in a permanent and written form within the VW, so they can be later discussed and addressed by the design team. Tutors may also arrange meetings in the VW with student groups beyond classroom hours to assist, answer questions and review their work.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Design review and user evaluation in the virtual world</h3><p>Another characteristic of the design studio is the review or jury, which is a formal exposition of the design from the student’s side to the tutor(s) and possibly other professionals outside the studio (Shaffer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Shaffer DW (2003) Portrait of the Oxford design studio: An ethnography of design pedagogy (WCER Working Paper No. 2003-11). Madison: University of Wisconsin-Madison" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR40" id="ref-link-section-d24591e935">2003</a>). In interaction design, it is often that the (groups of) students can also provide critique on their teammates’ work; for example, in the prototype walkthrough (Hundhausen et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Hundhausen C, Fairbrother D, Petre M (2010) The “Prototype walkthrough”: a studio-based learning activity for the next generation of HCI education. In: Proceedings of next generation of HCI and education: CHI 2010 Workshop on UI Technologies and Educational Pedagogy" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR28" id="ref-link-section-d24591e938">2010</a>), a group of students presents their low-fidelity prototype to the class having one of their members play the role of the user who thinks aloud and other students can interrupt at any time with questions and comments.</p><p>Furthermore, for interaction design it is important that users can test and evaluate the outcome of the design. Therefore, HCI evaluation methods can also be employed in interaction design, where end-users are considered the “experts” who are to be engaged by the design team in the evaluation of the digital artifact according to various elements of measuring the user experience (e.g., Tullis and Albert <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Tullis T, Albert B (2008) Measuring the user experience, Elsevier" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR43" id="ref-link-section-d24591e944">2008</a>).</p><p>The design review can also take place in the VW through formal presentations of the design solution and questions and discussions about it. More important is the fact that tutors and students may explore the design models and prototypes prior to their final presentation and thus be able to post their comments and ask for further explanations of design choices. The advantage of using an integrated platform in this activity is that the learning community has the chance to see not only the final outcome but also the resources and paradigms that led to it, provided that the students are indeed using the VW to share them. Therefore, they can better assess both the result itself and the proper use of the methods by the student teams.</p><p>Avatar-based user evaluation methods may be applied in the VW, provided that the design solution has been constructed in appropriate detail. Users may evaluate the aesthetics and affordances of the prototype by observing its 3D form and exploring its structure within the VW, or they may evaluate its usability by testing its interactive behavior in pre-defined scenarios. In this case the realistic scale of the designed artifact may improve the quality of the evaluation, for example, if the avatar can use a product in a way similar to its actual use, it might be easier to imagine oneself actually using it and thus to detect ergonomic or usability issues. Immersive virtual environments are already being used successfully for ergonomic and usability evaluation of new products (Bruno and Muzzupappa <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Bruno F, Muzzupappa M (2010) Product interface design: a participatory approach based on virtual reality.

Finally, besides questionnaires and interviews, simple interactive tools such as ratings, positive/negative feedback and comments may also be used in the VW and be associated with specific aspects of the prototype to further assist the evaluation process.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec10"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec10-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec10">A virtual world interaction design studio course</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content"><p>Following the proposed approach described in the previous section, we have set up a VW, built the appropriate workplaces and tools and used it to support a postgraduate interaction design studio course that ran through a whole semester.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">The virtual world platform</h3><p>We have set up a VW server using the OpenSimulator platform. OpenSimulator is an open-source platform for hosting VWs that includes most of the functionality of Second Life. We decided to use OpenSimulator instead of the more popular Second Life for the following reasons: (a) given that the platform was installed in our own servers, we had more freedom to configure the environment, control user access and store the user-generated content for future reference; (b) the majority of student activities required images to be uploaded to the VW (e.g., sketches, models, concepts and prototypes), and Second Life charges a price per image upload; (c) most of the features of Second Life are already supported by the OpenSimulator platform including the LSL that we used for development and (d) OpenSimulator has extended LSL functionality with additional functions (OSSL functions), some of which were necessary for building the supporting tools. More specifically, there are OSSL functions for dynamically drawing on 3D surfaces that were needed by sketching and messaging tools.</p><p>The OpenSimulator installation was enhanced with a MySQL database for storing the VW content and with a Freeswitch server for voice communication support. Students and tutors could log into the VW using the Hippo Viewer or any other Second Life-compatible browser. The VW was installed in standalone mode—it was isolated from other regions to provide restricted access for students and tutors only.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">The virtual interaction design studio tools</h3><p>We have developed a number of interactive tools (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig1">1</a>) to support collaborative design activities in the VW. The tools have been designed on the basis of the identified student activities that could take place within the VW throughout the course (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Tab1">1</a>) and have been developed using the LSL/OSSL.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig1_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-1-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig1_HTML.gif" alt="figure1" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-1-desc"><p>The interactive tools of the VW design studio</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec13">Presentations</h4><p>We have built two tools for presentations, either in the whole class or within the same group, the <i>Projector</i> and the <i>Projector Controller</i>. Students are having their own copy of the Projector Controller, through which they can upload and control their presentations. Any presentation can be imported to a Projector Controller as a sequence of images and is displayed on its own small screen. A student may then connect his/her own controller to the Projector and display the presentation to the rest of the group using the “Next,” “Previous” and “Reset” buttons of the controller. The Projector has also a “laser pointer” feature for referring to the contents of the screen—if any user clicks on the screen, a red dot appears on the point of reference.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec14">Annotations</h4><p>Annotations are essential objects for asynchronous collaboration. In our VW, they have been used for storing comments, questions, explanations or simply for coordinating the design activities. Students were provided with the <i>Annotation</i> and <i>Short Annotation</i> objects, and they could create multiple copies of them, define their contents and place them anywhere in the environment. Each Annotation object has a floating title and includes a note card with the annotated text that can be read by simply clicking on it. The Short Annotation is a similar object that has only a floating text readable by anyone.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec15">Collaborative boards</h4><p>Students were provided with four distinct tools that worked as boards for collaboration. The <i>Message Board</i> displays a text-only whiteboard, on which any student can add a new message. It has been used for storing ideas, facts or simply group meeting notes. The <i>Sketch Board</i> is a white surface on which users can draw sketches by simple mouse clicking and dragging. Students used it to quickly present new concepts to each other. To create more sophisticated and accurate drawings, they were equipped with the <i>Drawing Board</i>: a tool that displays Google Docs drawings in the VW and lets visitors immediately connect and edit the document. Finally, a <i>Post</i>-<i>it Board</i> object was also available for students to add text messages on it in the form of colored Post-it notes.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec16">Recording</h4><p>The <i>Chat Recorder</i> tool was provided to the students to record chat sessions, play them back or save them as note cards. It has been used for storing group discussion logs or for recording comments. However, due to restrictions of the LSL, it could not record voice communications; in that case, students would have to use external recording software.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec17">Resources</h4><p>Students needed to store the resources related to their research in the VW and communicate them to others for later reference. Given that most resources are available on the web (e.g., papers, web pages, images, etc.), they were provided with the <i>Resource</i> object that displays a short description of the document it points to and opens the hyperlink in a new browser window when clicked.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec18">User interface prototypes</h4><p>We have designed and implemented the <i>Interface Element</i> tool for the implementation of the functional user interface prototype. Using multiple copies of this object, students can progressively construct windows containing elements such as buttons and images and define their behavior using simple commands. Each working element can have one or more of the following functions: (a) operate as a button that can send events to other elements (or itself) when clicked, (b) operate as a window, which can contain other elements and can show or hide based on the event it receives and (c) operate as an Image Container, which contains a number of images and may display the next, previous or any indexed image based on the event it receives.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">The virtual design studio workplaces</h3><p>We constructed a number of in-world workplaces to support the interaction design studio activities. The workplaces are the following:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <i>Classroom</i>: There was a single classroom in a central place in the VW to be utilized for class activities. This room was mainly used during the presentation sessions to let groups display their progress and explain their decisions to the rest of the class. It has been designed as a meeting space with a Projector on one wall and a large table with chairs around it for students and tutors. In the entrance there was a space for tutors’ announcements, while any notes created by the tutors during class presentations were added as digital content in the classroom’s boards.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <i>Private rooms</i>: Each user had her own private room for which she had exclusive control of the entrance to allow for privacy. Students could insert and organize their own resources and freely develop their own concepts before presenting them to the rest of the group.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <i>Group collaboration rooms</i>: There was one room for each group to be used for collaborative design and learning activities. It was equipped with appropriate interactive tools and furniture (tables, chairs, etc.), and groups were encouraged to design their space according to their own needs and planned activities. The role of these rooms was to support group meetings, to be used as places to collaboratively construct and present sketches and models, to store resources (web pages, papers, etc.), to place comments and notes on the project’s progress, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <i>Prototyping rooms</i>: One room was allocated to each group to be used for virtual prototyping. The room was initially empty, and students were encouraged to construct a functional prototype of their designed artifact using the appropriate tools and to place it in a realistic digital context. The prototype has then been evaluated by other users that interact with it as avatars.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Overview of the course</h3><p>The interaction design studio course is offered at the second semester of the MSc program in Design of Interactive and Industrial Products and Systems, at the University of the Aegean, Greece. This is a transformation program that accepts candidates from a variety of disciplines related to design (e.g., computer science, engineering and architecture) and provides them with skills that enable them to make use of scientific and creative methods and technology, in order to contribute to the design of functional and usable products and services.</p><p>During the course, a problem-based learning (PBL) approach (Wood <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Wood DF (2003) ABC of learning and teaching in medicine: problem based learning. British Med J 326(7384):328–330" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d24591e1149">2003</a>; Hmelo-Silver <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Hmelo-Silver CE (2004) Problem-based learning: what and how do students learn? Educ Psychol Rev 16(3):235–266" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR27" id="ref-link-section-d24591e1152">2004</a>) was followed in which students work in groups to deal with a problem that is related to practice and in which they are responsible for their own learning (self-directed learning) on the basis of their particular project, judgement and experience, while tutors act as facilitators of group work mainly in terms of asking questions to incite students’ line of thought.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec21">Design brief</h4><p>The design project given to students was to design a (multi)touch interactive table or kiosk for a public place like a cafeteria/cinema/theater, considering alternative installations and types of services, reaching to a functional prototype about form, ergonomics and user interface and interaction. Students had to work in groups and to make careful and justified use of design methods and evaluate the prototype with users.</p><p>The design brief was presented along with some other interesting projects and examples to stimulate students’ ideas and interest. Students posted the design brief into their workplaces and asked questions to make sense of the project, identify the specific context of their application on the basis of their interests and reflect on their skills and experience. Students kept notes (annotations) in the VW next to the design brief to keep track of the issues that had to be further pursued.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec22">Design research</h4><p>The design project presented students with an authentic situation that had to be investigated in detail to make sense of the particular client and user requirements. Students had to make use of research methods like interviews, observation, data gathering and knowledge modeling about user requirements and the context of application.</p><p>Each student group followed a different approach to design research on the basis of what they deemed important for design. This was one of the primary targets of the pedagogical approach followed in this studio course: to stimulate students to make a justified use of different methods, based on the problem faced and their judgment. For example, one team (information kiosk at a theater) made use of contextual design models for representing requirements (Beyer and Hortzblatt <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Beyer H, Hortzblatt K (1997) Contextual design: defining customer-centered systems (1st ed) Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d24591e1173">1997</a>), while another team (multitouch cafeteria table) rested on interviews from potential users and started sketching alternate concepts of the table. To justify those approaches for design research, the first team reported that the stakeholders of the theater wanted to put emphasis on ticket booking and selling through the kiosk—and thus, an organizational view of the theater was required, and the contextual design approach was preferred. The second team found that the user experience of “hanging-out” in the cafeteria was the driving design issue of their work, so they felt like experimenting for the very start with sketching and concepts of the user experience of interacting with a multitouch table.</p><p>The design research activities included work both in field and in the VW and lasted for a total of 3 weeks. The former included the conduction of interviews and observation, taking photographs and collecting related documentation (e.g., the menu of the cafeteria); the latter was about modeling, posting, documenting and commenting on this material in the group workplace (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig2">2</a>). The process of making sense of the data and building related models occurred in physical meetings of student groups as well as in virtual meetings in the VW (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig3">3</a>). The outcomes and models including personas, work models and a list of guidelines and constraints were posted in the VW group workplaces, presented by the groups and commented by the tutors. We kept track of the discussions for future reference, and corrections and areas of improvement were identified.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig2" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 2</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/2" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig2_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-2-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="figure2" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-2-desc"><p>Design research documents arranged in the group workplace</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/2" data-track-dest="link:Figure2 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

                  <h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec23">Design thinking</h4><p>The third activity that was taking place during the course time was (group) design thinking. Design thinking is an activity that happened in every session of the VW design studio and followed a number of different methods; this depended on the phase of design work and the particular requirements of the project. Thus, interpretation sessions were used by one team that followed the contextual design method to better understand user requirements and design guidelines; scenario-based design was used by all teams to make sense of types of intended use of the object system by potential users (personas), which resulted in storyboards; brainstorming was used to come up with ideas for user interface design. These methods were used by student groups alone during the week intervals, and their results were documented in the VW (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig4">4</a>).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig4_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-4-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="figure4" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"><p>Design thinking results posted in the VW</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/4" data-track-dest="link:Figure4 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                  <p>In addition, during the course sessions, design thinking was modeled as a simple PBL tutorial process (Wood <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Wood DF (2003) ABC of learning and teaching in medicine: problem based learning.

The aim of this activity for each group was to complete a PBL whiteboard similar to that of Hmelo-Silver (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Hmelo-Silver CE (2004) Problem-based learning: what and how do students learn?

                    <i>),</i> including the identification of facts, learning issues, ideas and action plan. The PBL session was held in the VW: Students discussed and filled in the PBL whiteboard, while tutors posed questions to stimulate the process and to challenge students’ thinking. The action plan was posted in the VW to be consulted for the next course session.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec24">Design practice</h4><p>Design practice occurred during the studio course sessions in which students developed various models about the form and function of the interactive system; this was carried on by students alone during the week interval.</p><p>Conceptual design was carried out with tools that included online 2D design tools for sketching of the basic layout and form of user interfaces as well as the construction of models like flow charts, concept models and storyboards. Detailed design was performed with online prototyping tools for the construction of wireframes and user interfaces. The VW offered interfaces with these online tools to allow students to work collaboratively if needed.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of interface element tool was used to develop a working prototype of the target system in the VW. The construction of working prototypes in the VW was optional for student teams. For example, one team opted to create a virtual prototype of the information kiosk for the theater inside the VW (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig5">5</a>). The other team opted to conduct a paper prototyping session in the physical design studio since they wanted to ultimately test their gesture-based interaction techniques for their multitouch table, and for which the specific implementation of the VW would not offer much support.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-5"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig5" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 5</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/5" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig5_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-5-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="figure5" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-5-desc"><p>A model of the theater used as a realistic context to place the kiosk prototype</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/5" data-track-dest="link:Figure5 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                  <h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec25">Desk crit</h4><p>The desk crit is both time and cognitively demanding for tutors, who have to pass from all students or teams (depending on the design task, design practice may occur in groups or atomically) and formulate the right questions and comments. The VW design studio afforded the conduction of desk crit in both synchronous and asynchronous manner. During the course sessions, tutors made oral discussions with students and groups, who recorded tutor questions and provided explanations. However, what was actually very helpful was the availability of student design work in the VW during the week interval. We kept visiting the VW to review student work during the week at a time of our convenience to provide feedback before the next course session.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec26">Design review and user evaluation</h4><p>The design review process concerned the intermediate design models that students developed throughout the lifetime of the course and of course subsequent versions of the interactive system. The design review occurred in open student group presentations in the VW, where tutors provided questions and comments on the designed artefacts focusing on challenging student options rather than providing workarounds and corrections. The latter was left to the students of other groups, who participated in the process by providing their opinions about potential solutions to problems posed by the tutors.</p><p>Furthermore, the user evaluation of an interactive prototype was conducted in the VW, which concerned an information kiosk that provided services about theater ticket reservations and audience reviews and recommendations (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig6">6</a>). Students set up a realistic digital environment of the kiosk and the theater and implemented the user interface with the interface element tools of the VW. Then they invited potential users (other students) to host a remote usability test in order to identify problems and to better inform their detailed design.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-6"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig6" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 6</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/6" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig6_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-6-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="figure6" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-6-desc"><p>User evaluation of the kiosk prototype: the user interface is presented both in realistic size (on the kiosk’s screen) and in larger scale for easier comprehension</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/6" data-track-dest="link:Figure6 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Assessment</h3><p>The assessment of the design studio course is presented in terms of student progress and learning outcomes, and the perceived usability of the VW platform and tools.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec28">Student progress and learning outcomes</h4><p>The introduction of VWs in a design studio course was not easy to digest by students at first. This was due to their lack of experience in using VWs and their unfamiliarity to the pedagogical approach used. With respect to the former, at the start of the course, we organized a tutorial to get students acquainted with the technology; this was a 2-hour session, in which students logged in the VW, designed their appearances, explored their digital workplaces and made use of the tools. With regard to the latter (PBL approach), we had to keep explaining the rationale of our facilitation in the first course sessions. A few students complained at first about the “lack of guidance” and “lack of corrections” on their work; however, they got used to the approach especially after they saw their teammates to cope well. Thus, despite that in the first couple of weeks student progress was slow, students showed a steep learning curve after that time and responded positively throughout the process recognizing its novelty and the value of the approach.</p><p>Student work has produced various outcomes. Students made use of interaction design methods in a self-directed manner. The application of methods occurred both in the field and in the VW, and most of the models produced were documented and exhibited in the VW, thus allowing remote and asynchronous feedback by teammates and tutors. Students applied a number of methods and processes in the VW like PBL tutorials, presentation and critique, brainstorming and usability evaluation. Additionally, students developed a digital prototype and conducted a remote usability evaluation in the VW.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec29">Perceived usability of the virtual world platform and tools</h4><p>For the evaluation of the VW environment, we first investigated the perceived usability of the VW tools with short questionnaires at the end of the course. Students were asked to rate their task performance (0:bad; 10:excellent) regarding the use of the VW for each one of the tools. Students’ responses (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig7">7</a>) indicate that they managed to make good use of most of the tools, especially the text chat, the Projector and Projector Controller, the message board, the short annotation and the interface element. For other tools students did not meet particular problems, with the exception of the drawing board and the sketch board for different reasons. The usability of the drawing board was not satisfactory because it required from students to configure its connection with Google Docs with a standard procedure each time they wanted to create a new drawing. The sketch board offered limited functionality to students: They had to use the mouse only to draw sketches with a single-style line, there were no accompanying templates or stencils for typical user interface objects, for example, buttons, and it supported only four colors.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 7</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig7_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-7-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig7_HTML.gif" alt="figure7" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-7-desc"><p>Students’ perceived usability of the VW tools (1: bad–10: excellent)</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/7" data-track-dest="link:Figure7 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                  <p>Furthermore, we investigated students’ perceived learning performance with respect to general skills and competencies of using the VW. We asked students to rate their performance with regard to a number of basic skills and competencies in the VW, like walking/flying, inspecting objects (magnifying/enlarging), managing objects in their inventory and managing access rights. Students were asked to reflect on their performance at the first course and rate it, and at the last course (0:bad; 10:excellent). Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#Fig8">8</a> shows the average, self-reported performance of students with respect to basic skills and competencies in the use of the VW. At the beginning of the course, students felt they had moderate capabilities; however, they all progressed significantly with the skill development in the use of VW. This is a very encouraging result with respect to the usability of VWs for inexperienced users and supports their wider use for learning and teaching.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-8"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig8" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 8</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/8" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig8_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-8-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-013-0221-1/MediaObjects/10055_2013_221_Fig8_HTML.gif" alt="figure8" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-8-desc"><p>Students’ general skills and competencies of using the VW (self-reporting)</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1/figures/8" data-track-dest="link:Figure8 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                  <p>Students were also asked to provide their views about whether VWs can effectively support collaborative learning and design. Their responses were positive of the potential, but they identified the need for improvements of technology and tools: A student remarked: “<i>I believe that VWs can help the cooperation of design professionals and educators, but they have not reached to a point that everything can be designed inside them. For example it is not possible to design a multi</i>-<i>touch table so that avatars can apply hand gestures.</i>” Another student highlighted the VW communication affordances and pointed the usability issues: “<i>From the experience gained, I think that VWs can significantly support collaborative learning in design because of the rich group communication; you can design spaces and prototypes easily and others can see how design is progressing in real time and intervene; however it is important to understand the possibilities and not be disappointed by the low usability of some functions and tools.</i>” Naturally, some VW tools have not yet been developed at the sophisticated level of their 2D counterparts, but on the other hand, the collocation and integration of people, activities and tools in the same digital space, along with some empowerments that VWs can afford (e.g., flying, magnifying, creating and cloning objects), offers an engaging and inspiring design and learning experience overall.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec30"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec30-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec30">Discussion and conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec30-content"><p>In this paper we have explored the use of a VW platform and developed tools to support interaction design studio teaching and learning. We have presented an approach that identifies prospective VW workspaces and tools for typical phases of the design studio, and we followed this to the conduction of a blended postgraduate course that ran for a whole semester. The experience gained from this application is supportive of the argument that VWs can add value to a number of design studio activities. The VW platform and the developed tools had a positive impact on design and educational activities in a number of ways:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Online meetings and presentations were conducted successfully because of the avatar representations, the voice and text chat capabilities and the effective use of the respective tools (Projector and Projector Controller) by students. Related design activities that have been supported from online meetings and presentations are the design brief, the design research (especially about presenting/discussing the documentation), design thinking and design review.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The ability to collaboratively build within the VW allowed students to easily create knowledge models about their design project (e.g., personas, flow charts, concept models, etc.). These were particularly required at the design research and the conceptual design stages of project development.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Students were provided with a tool (Interface Element) that allowed them to build simple 3D prototypes. The fact that VWs support 3D interactions through mouse clicks and can trigger custom object and avatar animations dynamically allowed for prototyping and remote user evaluation of some functional aspects of an interactive system.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Another important positive aspect of the VW was its persistence that helped students and tutors follow up easily with the progress of the projects, and the affordances to collaboratively arrange objects in the environment that let students formulate their own working places, organize their resources and exhibit their work.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <p>Considering the use of the tools, most of them have been extensively used by the student groups, despite some usability problems faced. Some of the tools have been used during all design phases: The Projector and Projector Controller have been used during presentations and meetings, and annotations have been regularly posted by students for keeping track of their progress and by tutors to send feedback and questions. The collaborative boards have been used during design research, design thinking and design practice phases to display ideas, plans, documents and diagrams. The drawing board allowed for collaborative creation and editing of drawings and charts, but it scored low usability by students. The message board was most useful due to its simplicity to post text documents in the VW. The interface element was necessary during the design practice to define the interactive behavior of the prototype. Its usefulness could be improved, if it supported a wider range of interactions and behaviors.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Besides the identified benefits, a number of limitations were also identified:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Some students had difficulties in collaboratively editing documents and drawings posted in the workplaces during design research and design thinking activities due to limitations of the platform and the tools.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Voice sessions could not be recorded within the VW, so they had to use text chat or external recording software if they wanted to record their discussions.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The prototypes proved difficult and time-consuming for most students to construct, and their interactivity was limited to point-and-click actions.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>It was difficult to interact with the prototype in physical size, and students had to build a larger size copy of the touch screen interface.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Avatar-based evaluation is suffering from known issues in remote usability evaluation, for example, the inability to observe user reactions (Castillo et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Castillo JC, Hartson R, Hix, D (1998) Remote usability evaluation: can users report their own critical incidents? In: Proceedings of the conference on human factors on computing systems (CHI’98) ACM Press, New York pp 253–254" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-013-0221-1#ref-CR26" id="ref-link-section-d24591e1483">1998</a>).</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <p>Some of these limitations were addressed during the course lifetime, while some others have now been resolved for future use. For example, the difficulty in creating complex 3D models and the time and effort it takes to generate new content were partially tackled with the use of pre-constructed content and with building blocks (like the interface element we used in our course) that can be easily combined to construct complex interactive systems. Also, the OpenSimulator platform currently allows a live web page to be placed on a surface, so student groups can include web-based collaborative tools in their workplaces.</p><p>The use of a VW for teaching interaction design studio had several implications on the tutors’ work as well. First of all, the fact that we could be aware of student progress and that we could inspect and comment on their work prior to the official presentation in class helped us to be better prepared and to intervene when appropriate. We believe that this awareness had a positive impact on the final outcome. However, we had to provide technical support very often to assist students in using the platform and its tools. It also took a significant amount of time to construct the initial workplaces, to manage user accounts and groups and to properly arrange and organize the content. Therefore, the need for additional personnel is certainly one of the challenges of using VWs in education. Nevertheless, if a significant number of courses include learning activities in the VW, the extra cost for technical support per single course is expected to be reduced.</p><p>The experience out of this course is certainly supportive of the use of VW interaction design studios. However, more work is required to various dimensions to address a number of more general challenges. These include the following: (a) refinement of the instructional approaches of VW design studios in order to encompass the particular characteristics of design studio constructivist pedagogies with the unique integrated set of VW affordances; (b) other mid- and long-term applications of VW design studios in more courses, and possibly other design disciplines; (c) further adaptation and application of interaction design methods in VW design studios, with the introduction of additional tools and processes; (d) improvements in usability and platform maturity; despite that we have seen that inexperienced users can make use of the tools, several problems may arise and further work in this direction is certainly required; (e) integration of VWs with other tools of professional design, like web prototyping tools, CAD software, image-editing tools and 2D design tools; this integration would critically improve the usefulness of VWs for design studio learning.</p></div></div></section>
