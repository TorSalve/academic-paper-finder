    <meta name="dc.description" content="With the development of computer software and hardware in the past few years, it has been possible to produce effective training virtual environments on everyday personal computers with little expert training required for users or designers. However, the development of the equipment that enables this has brought little coinciding research on what features to include when designing these environments. Despite these increased advances in PC capabilities for desktop virtual environments (VEs), there are still limitations on the number of objects that can be programmed to be interactive, usually due to restrictions on programming time and cost. As a result, it is often left to the programmer to decide which of the objects included to increase the realism of the environment will be interactive and which aesthetic. The work presented in this paper is an experiment that aims to establish a guide for environment designers to aid effective environment interaction development by identifying key elements in a VE design."/>

However, the development of the equipment that enables this has brought little coinciding research on what features to include when designing these environments. Despite these increased advances in PC capabilities for desktop virtual environments (VEs), there are still limitations on the number of objects that can be programmed to be interactive, usually due to restrictions on programming time and cost. As a result, it is often left to the programmer to decide which of the objects included to increase the realism of the environment will be interactive and which aesthetic. The work presented in this paper is an experiment that aims to establish a guide for environment designers to aid effective environment interaction development by identifying key elements in a VE design.</p></div></div></section>

Typical interaction in desktop virtual environments (VEs) is usually split into navigation and object manipulation. In addition, in order to cope with the relative simplicity of the input devices traditionally used (mouse and joystick), participants are presented with both the physical interface of the input device and the virtual interface, usually comprising a screen overlay, toolbar or “move bar”, or prompts, cues or instructions embedded within the VE. This combination of interfaces and types of interaction presents a challenge in the development of VEs in terms of usability of the environment, presence experienced and the resulting effectiveness of the VE.</p><p>Due to these restrictions on input devices, it is very difficult to have natural or intuitive interaction metaphors within the desktop environment. However, the use of a mouse as an interaction device takes advantage of existing user expectations from PC use by, for example, using a click to cause an object response. Similarly, games use has led to the mapping between joystick movement and movement within a virtual world to be consistent in terms of forwards and backwards movement and rotating left and right.</p><p>A number of users have adopted desktop VR (e.g. within education, training etc.) as a low-cost solution that provides 3D interaction without the need to commit to the purchase of an expensive, dedicated piece of hardware. This paper examines the way in which the virtual interface should be designed to enhance interaction, usability and effectiveness, based on the assumption that only basic input devices will be used.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">Interaction design for desktop virtual environments</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><p>The importance of realism, interaction and control of movement as an aspect of VE applications was explored in Marshall et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Marshall E, Nichols S, Wilson JR (2003) Interaction, control of movement and realism: establishing the factors influencing virtual reality training.

It has long been assumed that interaction is a “good thing”; for example in a training VE, it could enhance the participant’s sense of being there (presence), the ease of use of the VE, and eventually the effectiveness of navigational and spatial information training that may result from the period of VE use. However, there is little empirical evidence available to support this notion. This paper presents an experiment that examines how to include interaction in a desktop VE and looks at whether the interaction adds to the effectiveness of the VE.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Existing definitions of interaction</h3><p>‘Interaction technique’ is the term used to describe the methods devised to communicate with and affect a VE, be it the interaction device itself or the theory behind its operation. Herndon et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Herndon KP, Van Dam A, Gleicher M (1994) The challenges of 3D interaction.

Exocentric can also be called a ‘god’s eye’ viewpoint, where the participant selects items from outside the environment to use within it. An egocentric, or ‘worm’s eye’ viewpoint, allows interaction to be performed directly within the environment. Therefore, a prediction would be that we would expect an environment that consisted of solely egocentric interaction to lead to a higher level of presence, as participants are not required to go ‘outside’ the environment in order to achieve interaction.</p><p>Bowman and Wingrave [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bowman DA, Wingrave CA (2001) Design and evaluation of menu systems for immersive virtual environments.

                    <li>
                      <p>Navigation – moving the viewpoint through an environment, achieving both cognitive (way finding) and motor (travel) goals.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Selection – the task of choosing one or more objects from a set.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Manipulation – changing to the specification of an object’s properties, i.e. position and orientation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>System control – changing system state or mode of interaction.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
<p>Within this classification, we were particularly interested in selection and manipulation. Navigation, particularly with only 4 degrees of freedom (forward, backwards, left, right), is effectively achieved via a joystick, which is emerging as a standard navigation input device. However, such standards for selection and manipulation have not yet been established.</p><p>Marsh and Wright [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Marsh T, Wright P (2000) Maintaining the illusion of interacting within a 3D virtual space.

Presence is then considered to be a result of participant interaction with the virtual space created by the virtual world and is ‘broken’ by awareness of the artificiality of the medium. It is claimed, therefore, that presence is hindered by the practical problems of the time and effort in producing the model and the complexity of that model.</p><p>Poupyrev et al.

It is also noted that ‘you should never have to read a label to understand how to use an object—its affordances should convey this information’. In addition, Marsh and Wright [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Marsh T, Wright P (2000) Maintaining the illusion of interacting within a 3D virtual space.

This puts forth a strong case for the inclusion of interaction within a VE to make it interesting, but from another angle the interaction method itself must also be made interesting to make the participant wish to interact initially and maintain his/her attention.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Interaction requirements</h3><p>From previous research and the authors’ own experience the following is assumed: If interaction is included in a desktop VE, it is important for the participant to: </p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">

<p>It is this final point that has been selected to study in greater detail as interaction forms a fundamental aspect of training within VEs. It provides a way of supplying more information about areas of the environment and to teach tasks within the environment to apply to the real world. Kaur et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Kaur K, Maiden N, Sutcliffe AG (1999a) Interacting with virtual environments: an evaluation model of interaction.

This demonstrates that the opportunity to interact with the VE is almost infinite, so ways of encouraging the user to interact with the important aspects of the environment and where interaction can be used most effectively is essential. To emphasise this, Kaur et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Kaur K, Maiden N, Sutcliffe AG (1999a) Interacting with virtual environments: an evaluation model of interaction.

Interaction hotspots are not centred on manipulation with the goal of position and orientation as such, but rather on visual or audible feedback such as a change in colour or texture or even additional information provided about a given object. The aim of an interaction hotspot is to suggest to a participant that interaction is possible with that object. Inevitably, within a VE there will be a large number of objects whose primary purpose is to add to photorealism and thus they do not respond to user input – for example, a picture on the wall in a VE may look realistic, but it is unlikely to fall off the wall if the participant bumps into it, as would happen in the real world.</p><p>In the experiment presented in this paper, we were interested in how different types of interaction prompts or cues affected the likelihood of interaction actually taking place, and whether the interaction impacted on the effectiveness of the period of VE use. Therefore, it was necessary to identify what types of interaction are possible in a VE.</p><p>Most work within the area of interaction in virtual worlds is concerned with the method of communicating user intentions to the virtual world, be it via the interaction device or the technique behind the use of that device. To date there has been little research into aspects that entice a user to interact with the environment and the consequences of that interaction; increased memory retention for training environments, increased enjoyment, effectiveness and usability are all possible consequences of well-designed interaction hotspots. Many areas of research into interaction techniques do provide useful information on aspects of interaction hotspot design such as the importance of feedback, affordances and so forth.</p><p>The concept of interaction hotspots falls within the categories of selection and manipulation within VE interaction and is mainly concerned with the selection of objects. This includes what prompts a user to select an object and the effect that selection has on the user, for example on memory retention. Interaction hotspots do not apply to the area of manipulation to such an extent, and although the object may be manipulated in some way within the environment, it is not the main purpose of that interaction. The consideration of interaction hotspots could prove important, even vital, for the design of an effective and usable VE for a given purpose, in particular a training environment where interaction hotspots can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to provide specific information about an item or to aid in the retention of that information or of the item’s location.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec7"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec7-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec7">Experiment design and development</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"><p>The aim of this experiment was to explore what prompts a user to interact with a VE.<i> ‘Interaction hotspots’</i> have been defined by the author as specific points within a VE that it is possible for the user to interact with.

According to Benjamin et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Benjamin LT, Hopkins RJ, Nation JR (1987) Psychology.

In addition, there are certain stimuli that are universally attention drawing (not mainly dependent on the individual), for example novelty (i.e. an object out of context), colour, movement, size and repetition. Hilgard et al.

<p>Also considered was how interaction hotspots within a VE may have an influencing effect on the usability of that environment. This may depend on many factors concerning the use and design of that environment. For example, if the task to be completed within the environment involves the manipulation of many objects, then it may be a highly influential factor. If the task requires navigation but little interaction, then the influence of interaction design may be greatly reduced. It may also be the case that if an object is required to perform the set task (i.e. it is dark and the participant needs to find a light switch to see what she is doing), the participant will actively seek out that object to interact with it. If this is the case, then it is less likely that the appearance of the object within the environment will be an influencing factor and more likely that its location relative to expectations from the real world will have an impact.</p><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Tab1">1</a> consolidates the authors’ expectations with respect to the design and positioning of interaction hotspots in a VE with reference to Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Fig1">1</a>.

<p>In addition to this, also considered in the design of interaction hotspots and the testing of their effectiveness was their usability within the environment. In work by Kaur et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Kaur Deol K, Sutcliffe AG, Maiden N (1999b) A design advice tool presenting usability guidance for virtual environments.

These factors in turn affect the design of hotspots because they limit the possible use of abstract colour/detail/movement/positioning. With this in mind, a set of cue types was developed (see Sect. 4.2 for details). The cues were chosen as they combined attention grabbing features that would not distract from the distinguishable and identifiable features of the environment as recommended by Kaur et al.

<p>It can be seen from the graph that the colours [both static (highlighted) and flashing] and sound appeared to be the most effective cues to interaction. However, the apparent low impact of texture, photorealistic and movement cues may be due to their general proliferation around the environment, and the relatively high number of non-interactive cues of this type (Sect. 4.2).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Does interacting with the VE influence effectiveness (transfer of knowledge, presence and usability) of the training environment?</h3><p>This research question was first examined by looking to see if there was any association between the total number of interactions with the environment and the performance on the recall task. No association between the number of attempted interactions and recall performance was found either for the entire participant group or when examining the task and free interaction groups separately (total:<i> r</i>=0.289,<i> df</i>=14,<i> p</i>&gt;0.05; specific task:<i> r</i>=−0.409,<i> df</i>=6,<i> p</i>&gt;0.05; free interaction:<i> r</i>=0.265,<i> df</i>=6,<i> p</i>&gt;0.05). However, it should be noted that, due to the large individual participant variability in number of interactions, the pattern between these two variables does not appear to be linear, and these correlation coefficients may be susceptible to influence from outliers.</p><p>The association between the number of successful interactions (i.e. those that elicited a visible or audible response from the VE object) and recall performance was also examined (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Fig4">4</a>).

<p>A significant overall association was found between the number of interactions with the objects specifically related to the recall task (i.e. the safety items) (<i>r</i>=0.662,<i> df</i>=14,<i>
p</i>&lt;0.005). However, on closer examination, this significant correlation appeared to be due to the fact that for the participants who completed the specific task, both number of clicks on the task-related items and performance on the recall task was higher, leading to an overall trend and positive correlation (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Fig5">5</a>).

<p>The relationship between number of interactions and successful interactions with presence and usability was also examined for the overall participant group.

df</i>=14,<i> p</i>&lt;0.001).

df</i>=10.08,<i> p</i>&gt;0.05). This was thought to be due to the inequality in variances between the two participant groups. </p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-5"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab5" data-test="table-caption">Table 5  Summary of interactions</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2/tables/5"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>In order to measure the VE effectiveness, the performance on the recall task, presence and usability ratings for the two groups were also compared (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Tab6">6</a>).

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Are presence, usability and recall performance related to each other?</h3><p>Finally correlations were used to examine the associations between presence, usability and recall performance. A significant positive correlation was found between presence and usability for all participants (<i>r</i>=0.745,<i>

The most effective interaction hotspots were the brightly coloured highlighted objects (both flashing and static) and sound. This may be due to the fact that the other cue types such as photo realism and texture may have seemed more likely to occur within either the VE or the real world normally (i.e. are less ecologically valid and therefore stand out more) and not solely to indicate that the object has a special purpose. For example, the bright colours used for highlighting and flashing around objects are less likely to be a part of the environment normally and as a result prompt more interest from the user and entice her to interact with the object.</p><p>This suggests that, if the objective of the environment being designed is to get the user to interact with the environment (i.e. to provide more information about the object being interacted with), then bright coloured cues are the best interaction hotspots to use.</p><p>It was also noted that a high percentage (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#Fig3">3</a>) of all the coloured cues in the entire environment were interacted with at some point by at least one participant. Though it is difficult to compare the use of different interaction cues directly in this experiment, as they all appeared differently and on different objects (so object type and location, for example, may come into consideration), this does provide another good indicator that they were the most effective interaction hotspots as they prompted the most overall interaction.</p><p>Interaction also increased significantly when there was no specific task for the user to perform in the environment. This may occur as the user becomes more singularly focused on the task and is less likely to notice or react to objects that are outside the requirements of that task. This also should be considered in environment development if the aim is to encourage user interaction, generally or specifically.</p><p>It was also noted that task performance (in the case of this experiment, object location recall in the real-world environment) was significantly associated with interaction with task-related items (i.e. objects to be recalled). This may be as a result of the interaction with an object causing memory consolidation (in this case the item location) for the user. The inclusion of a task is therefore an important consideration if an environment is being designed to teach the user about a specific aspect of that environment.</p><p>A significant positive relationship was evident between presence and usability, demonstrating that these aspects of the VE experience are related. As a result, both are important considerations in the design of an environment, and their influence on other factors of design and effectiveness of a VE should be considered.</p><p>There was no clear relationship between the number of interactions and usability and the number of interactions and presence; this indicates that interaction neither adds to nor detracts from the presence or usability experienced by the user. This is important information to an environment designer if she wants to include interaction in a VE but is concerned with its negative effect on these aspects of user experience.</p><p>There was no significant relationship between presence and the correct recall of items (i.e. task performance) and usability and the correct recall of items. This suggests that neither factor is essential in environment design to make the environment effective, although their influence on other factors in the user’s experience, such as enjoyment and ability to perform the task, were not measured in this experiment. Therefore, the importance of presence and usability should not be discounted on the basis of this work alone.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Conclusions</h3><p>Overall, the data obtained from this study suggest that interaction in a VE is important for task effectiveness to a certain extent, particularly when the interaction is directly related to the task being completed by the VE participant. Therefore, the inclusion of interactive elements in a desktop VE should be carefully considered, and if time/effort decisions are being made, detailed interaction should be programmed for aspects of the interaction that are directly related to the goal of the VE.</p><p>Of the different interaction cues included in the VE, colour appeared to be an effective cue that encouraged interaction, both when flashing and statically highlighted around an object. This is likely to be due to the fact that these cues are artificial and not predictable from the participant’s experience of the real world. Therefore, this result may not be transferable to abstract VEs that do not represent real-world images in some way (i.e. do not allow the participant to transfer their previous knowledge when attempting to use the VE intuitively). It is also important to note that, whilst these cues appeared to encourage more interaction, the usefulness of that interaction in terms of the goal of the VE (training memory for object location) was less clear and certainly appeared low in comparison to the importance of type of instruction (task-specific or free interaction) given to the participant.</p><p>One challenge that was encountered during this study, and has been experienced in previous research in VR, is the vast individual differences in participant behaviour (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Nichols S (1999) Virtual reality induced symptoms and effects (VRISE): methodological and theoretical issues. PhD Thesis, University of Nottingham" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#ref-CR13" id="ref-link-section-d11898e2143">13</a>]). This possibly contributed to the lack of significant statistical findings in some parts of the experiment, as in several cases very large standard deviations were observed, and for example, the number of interactions by participants ranged from 446 to 0! This is due to the very nature of VR and a direct result of the fact that one of the benefits of a VE is that it allows freedom of movement and interaction. However, this lack of consistency between participants does present challenging methodological problems.</p><p>As has been found in previous research [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Marshall E, Nichols S, Wilson JR (2003) Interaction, control of movement and realism: establishing the factors influencing virtual reality training. In: Proceedings of the HCI International, (1):1188–1192" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0132-2#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d11898e2149">1</a>], and would be expected from theoretical predictions, presence and usability were positively correlated. It was also expected that a high level of interaction would also have contributed to usability and presence, if indeed, as is commonly assumed, interaction is a ‘good thing’. The results from this study do not support this assumption unless interaction is task directed, and importantly, interaction was also not found to have a negative impact on VE effectiveness.</p><p>One suspicion is that something that is enhanced by increased levels of interaction is the participant’s enjoyment of her experience in the VE. Therefore, participant enjoyment is being examined in a later study in this programme of research.</p><p>This study has not been able to conclusively show the benefit of interaction but has highlighted some differences among interaction cue types and illustrated the importance of task context for VE effectiveness. Therefore, it is vital that research continue to examine this issue so that appropriate design decisions can be made in order to ensure that effective VEs are developed in as efficient a manner as possible.</p></div></div></section>
