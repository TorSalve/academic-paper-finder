    <meta name="dc.description" content="Several studies indicate that virtual reality (VR) systems are useful for end-user participation in an environmental design process. However, these systems can be costly and thus support for the decision whether to invest in a VR of some type is useful. This study presents a novel method for analysing the usefulness of a VR system for the purpose of end-user participation. We collected qualitative end-user opinion data in the real environment and then contrasted this data with the capabilities of a VR system. Additionally, to better understand the capabilities of the VR used, we examined how the end-users perceive the used virtual environment, which in this case was CAVE, an immersive VR system where projectors are directed to the walls of a room-sized cube. In this way, we analysed whether the same functions and elements identified by end-users on the actual wards could also be evaluated in the CAVE. Eleven nurses and 11 patients participated in the study by evaluating a bathroom and/or four patient rooms modelled by the CAVE and the actual hospital wards. The CAVE was convenient for evaluating most issues identified by the study participants in the actual hospital wards, i.e. aesthetics; correct location of equipment, supplies and materials; distraction by or the good companion of other patients as well as window position and size and living/workspace. However, it was not possible to evaluate with full certainty the possibilities for bracing against grab bars or other objects in the VR, and this was found to be relevant to the independent functioning of patients with limited mobility. Also, due to the relatively low luminance levels of projectors, evaluations regarding lighting were considered unreliable. Moreover, end-users were not always certain about the sizes and sufficiency of space in the CAVE. Solutions to overcome these limitations were proposed."/>

However, these systems can be costly and thus support for the decision whether to invest in a VR of some type is useful. This study presents a novel method for analysing the usefulness of a VR system for the purpose of end-user participation. We collected qualitative end-user opinion data in the real environment and then contrasted this data with the capabilities of a VR system. Additionally, to better understand the capabilities of the VR used, we examined how the end-users perceive the used virtual environment, which in this case was CAVE, an immersive VR system where projectors are directed to the walls of a room-sized cube. In this way, we analysed whether the same functions and elements identified by end-users on the actual wards could also be evaluated in the CAVE. Eleven nurses and 11 patients participated in the study by evaluating a bathroom and/or four patient rooms modelled by the CAVE and the actual hospital wards. The CAVE was convenient for evaluating most issues identified by the study participants in the actual hospital wards, i.e. aesthetics; correct location of equipment, supplies and materials; distraction by or the good companion of other patients as well as window position and size and living/workspace. However, it was not possible to evaluate with full certainty the possibilities for bracing against grab bars or other objects in the VR, and this was found to be relevant to the independent functioning of patients with limited mobility. Also, due to the relatively low luminance levels of projectors, evaluations regarding lighting were considered unreliable. Moreover, end-users were not always certain about the sizes and sufficiency of space in the CAVE. Solutions to overcome these limitations were proposed.</p></div></div></section>

Thus, by improving physical settings hospitals could be more healing, safer and better places to work (Ulrich et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Ulrich RS, Zimring C, Joseph A, Quan X, Choudhary R (2004) The role of the physical environment in the hospital of the 21st century: a once in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Center for Health Design, Concord" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d32e376">2004</a>). Shortfalls in the health care workforce are a global issue that will increase in developed countries due to the ageing of the population (World Health Organization <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="World Health Organization (2006) The world health report 2006: working together for health. WHO, Geneva" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR18" id="ref-link-section-d32e379">2006</a>). Hence, it is increasingly important that designs of health care facilities do not cause any additional burden for individuals working in the field. As hospital buildings are likely to remain in place for decades, and as the EBD-literature indicates a relation between physical settings and health, it can be argued that it is useful to invest in building and designing better hospital facilities and so avoid longer-term costs.</p><p>Communicating with the end-users group can be crucial in building design. A key issue in this communication is the way in which the designs are presented to the end-users. Traditional visualisation means are, for example, sketches, scale models and photomontages. In hospital design, full-scale completed mock-ups have also been used to test designs with end-users. However, the use of traditional visualisation tools for user participation can inhibit feedback and cause a loss of information because they lack practicality and easy access to different views (Al-Kodmany <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Al-Kodmany K (1999) Using visualization techniques for enhancing public participation in planning and design: process, implementation, and evaluation. Landsc Urban Plan 45(1):37–45" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d32e385">1999</a>), and full-scale mock-ups can be time-consuming and expensive to build. Virtual reality (VR) systems might offer a useful tool for the purpose of conveying ideas to end-users. However, for a hospital design team to decide whether to invest in VR systems, they would have to understand the strengths and limitations of these systems. Further, in order to achieve this understanding, a method that identifies the strengths and limitations of a VR system should be developed.</p><p>This paper serves three purposes. First, it presents a case in which end-users evaluate patient room designs with a VR system. Second, and more importantly, it presents a method for evaluating VR systems. The method includes collecting qualitative end-user opinion data in the actual premises that are currently in use and contrasting this data to features of a VR system. With this approach, we examine whether or not the used VR model enables evaluations of all features that are noted to be relevant in the actual environment. The rationale of the method is simple: if some environmental feature is, for example, disturbing in the end-users’ perception in the actual environment, the end-users should be able to evaluate this feature also in the VR system. Otherwise, there is a limitation in the used VR system as it does not enable end-users to evaluate the features of the environment that were assessed in the actual environment. The third purpose of this paper converges with the second purpose as it is about examining features of the used VR system in the light of users’ perception. More precisely, the paper studies whether the end-users’ specifically identify issues about which they are uncertain as to whether the features are correctly or reliably observed in the VR. Also of interest is how the study participants evaluate and experience the VR system itself and whether they consider the presentations in the VR to be realistic.</p><p>We have used the CAVE<sup>®</sup> Automatic Virtual Environment in this research and applied the technology for aiding end-user participation in the patient room design process. CAVE is a VR theatre shaped as a cube with display screens that surround a viewer as presented and defined by Cruiz-Neira et al.

An immersive 3D virtual environment was presented to courtroom judges with a curved front projection screen illuminated by three pairs of projectors. The authors concluded that the design session was shorter with the use of VR than with a completed plywood courtroom mock-up. An important aspect of courtroom design is to achieve appropriate sightlines from the various vantage points of courtroom occupants. VR allowed the occupants to virtually be “seated” in various positions while maintaining the same view for all the participants. This made it easier to focus the shared attention and perspective of the participants on one sightline at a time. Thus, a more rapid consensus building and resolution of issues were enabled.</p><p>In Heldal’s (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Heldal I (2007) Supporting participation in planning new roads by using virtual reality systems.

In the study, VR was introduced to the users with a workbench equipped with active stereo glasses and a stereo display. The researchers found that sufficient levels of realism in the VR environment, such as spatialised 3D sound, high-detail vegetation and shadows, as well as the presence of rendered crowds, are significant for the design process and for communicating about designs. They allow a better sense of scale and overall ambience plus a better perception of space and physical objects. Furthermore, the authors reported that respondents found the VR environment to be effective, pleasant and easy to use as a design tool.</p><p>Mobach (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Mobach MP (2008) Do virtual worlds create better real worlds?

By studying this, he examined whether the VR-aided collaborative design process could benefit an organisation in such a way that improves the actual performance of the organisation working in the planned environment. The VR environment was introduced with a cylindrical screen by means of three projectors. Stereo effect was created with shutter glasses. The VR-aided design process resulted in changes in the design, improved staff satisfaction and reduced costs.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the use of a CAVE-type VR in a collaborative design process.

However, VR systems are quite expensive, especially when considering high-end immersive system such as CAVE, which demands a large infrastructure. It is therefore relevant to critically consider the uses and benefits of such systems. Our approach to this was to study how end-users evaluate non-virtual environments and thus infer what types of evaluations the VR system should facilitate in collaborative design sessions.</p><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab1">1</a> presents the main research question in a nutshell.

The CAVE in question was based on a cluster of computers. It had five rear-projected walls in a cubic arrangement in a way that it was a full closed cube with the exception of one vertical wall that was absent. Thus, it could cover the user’s entire field of view when the user is situated with their back towards the absent wall (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig1">1</a>). Digital light processing (DLP) projectors were used to display a stereo image on each wall, giving a three-dimensional view through shutter glasses. The user was tracked by the Flock of Birds magnetic tracking system from Ascension Technology, allowing them to move around in the model (within the physical bounds of the CAVE room).

                     <p>The rooms were modelled in 3ds Max from Autodesk, based on CAD models, photographs and floor layouts. Realistic surface materials and lighting were simulated using texture mapping and radiosity methods. The window views were based on actual fish eye photographs. A model for real-time viewing was made by pre-rendering the lighting into texture maps. This model was then viewed and navigated in the CAVE using VR4MAX from Tree C.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Rooms modelled to the CAVE</h3><p>Four patient rooms and a bathroom were presented in the CAVE environment. All room types and the bathroom concept were represented in one model built around a hospital corridor. Two of the room types, a one-patient room (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig2">2</a>) (17.0 m<sup>2</sup>) and a two-patient room (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig3">3</a>) (25.0 m<sup>2</sup>), were consistent with Finnish national healthcare guidelines and were to be utilised in a soon-to-be completed hospital building. This new hospital ward is a collaboration project between two Finnish regional health care providers, these being the Central Hospital of South Ostrobothnia and the Health Centre of Seinäjoki. The latter two of the four patient rooms differ significantly from the typical Finnish patient room models, one roughly following the two-bed concept as found in the Swedish Norrtälje Hospital (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig4">4</a>) while the other was inspired by models used in the USA (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig5">5</a>). The Swedish design is slightly larger (29.0 m<sup>2</sup>) than the planned two-patient room, and beds are located lengthwise opposite to each other and not the usual side by side. One-patient design from the USA introduces a king-size room (29.2 m<sup>2</sup>), colourful walls and a sofa for visitors and relatives.

To achieve this aim, the studies of Douglas and Douglas served as examples, where semi-structured interviews were used to study patients’ perceptions regarding hospital environments (Douglas and Douglas <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Douglas CH, Douglas MR (2004) Patient-friendly hospital environments: exploring the patients’ perspective.

By similar methods, our study explored end-users’ views about the environment in the CAVE and in the actual hospital wards.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec6">Study participants</h3><p>The study participants were nurses and patients from a rehabilitation ward and an acute ward of the Health Centre of Seinäjoki and from a neurological rehabilitation ward of the Seinäjoki Central Hospital. The data collection was made between October 2007 and January 2008.</p><p>Six patients were interviewed in the CAVE and six in the hospital wards. One patient was interviewed both in the CAVE and in the actual hospital. The patients interviewed were aged from 43 to 81 years (mean age being 70 years), two of them were males. The patients in the CAVE, of which two were also males, were aged from 56 to 83 years (mean age being 76 years). Nurses in the three hospital wards selected the participants for the study on the basis that participants would have sufficient capabilities to communicate their views and that they would not find the study situation too stressful or physically challenging.</p><p>Six nurses, all but one of whom were women, evaluated the environment in the wards. Each of the three wards was evaluated by a pair of nurses. The nurses were aged from 26 to 58 years (mean age being 49 years) and had twenty or more years work experience in nursing, with the exception of one nurse who had less than 2 years work experience. Six nurses were interviewed in the CAVE. These nurses were all women and were aged from 34 to 47 years (mean age being 38 years). They had an average of 10 years work experience (range 3–25 years).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec7">Data collection in the hospital wards</h3><p>The patients and the nurses evaluated the environment in the wards where they were treated or worked. The patients were interviewed by the researchers. The nurses evaluated their ward in pairs in accordance with instructions given to them. During the interviews, patients’ opinions were elicited on the following features: (a) colours, (b) lighting, (c) placement of furniture, (d) surface materials, (e) size of the room, (f) windows, (g) pleasantness, (h) aesthetics and (i) practicality of the room in general. We were inspired to choose these topics because in a comprehensive review of evidence-based design literature, an association has been found between these issues and patient well-being and safety (Ulrich et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Ulrich RS, Zimring C, Joseph A, Quan X, Choudhary R (2004) The role of the physical environment in the hospital of the 21st century: a once in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Center for Health Design, Concord" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d32e677">2004</a>). Opinions regarding these issues were collected first by directly asking whether they, for example, perceived the size of the room to be sufficient. Then, they were asked to explain why they held this opinion. In this manner, the topics listed previously served as starting points, and the discussion that followed was allowed to flow freely.</p><p>Patients were also asked whether they would change or add something to the environment, and they were encouraged to express freely whatever came to mind about the environment. In practice, for each room discussed, after other issues had been covered, the participating patient was first asked to tell us what, if anything, they would change in the room and then they were asked to tell anything that came to their mind that had not yet been discussed regarding the environment. The interviews were recorded, and the features discussed in the environment were photographed.</p><p>The interviews were started in the patient’s room and then, if the patient was not too fatigued, he/she guided the interviewer and the photographer to other rooms and environments where he/she had spent time during his/her hospitalisation.</p><p>The nurses were instructed to evaluate their ward in a certain manner and given a written instruction (see Index 1). They were also given a digital camera to photograph the features they discussed and a digital recorder for recording their discussion. They were instructed to discuss and photograph the rooms and environments, noting which details they found (a) relaxing or stress inducing, (b) aesthetic or non-aesthetic, (c) pleasant or unpleasant, (d) well implemented or impractical for working, (e) well implemented or inconvenient for patient well-being or (f) well or poorly functioning. Furthermore, they were instructed to explain why the environments or features in the environments could be described with some of the previously mentioned adjectives.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec8">Data collection in the CAVE</h3><p>Before interviews in the CAVE, the study participants were told that if they felt too stressed or if inappropriate feelings occurred during the interview, they could demand a pause or discontinue the interview. Study participants were encouraged to move freely in the CAVE-cube. Longer distances, e.g. from one room to another, were moved by a research assistant with a joystick. The patients were given the opportunity to sit during the interviews. If the patient chose to sit all movement was made with the joystick. The interviews were recorded and videotaped to observe the participants’ behaviour (Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig6">6</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig7">7</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Fig8">8</a>).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-6"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig6" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 6</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x/figures/6" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0138-x/MediaObjects/10055_2009_138_Fig6_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-6-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0138-x/MediaObjects/10055_2009_138_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="figure6" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-6-desc"><p>Patient interview in the CAVE</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x/figures/6" data-track-dest="link:Figure6 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

                        <p>The patients’ interviews in the CAVE covered the same topics as (colours, lighting, placement of furniture, surface materials, size of the room, window view as well as pleasantness, aesthetics and practicality of the room in general) and were also carried out according to the same principles (an opportunity to speak freely was given and reasons for views were asked) as on the wards.</p><p>Furthermore, the patients were asked (a) how they felt about being in the CAVE, (b) if they had any pleasant or unpleasant experiences, (c) did it feel like being inside a real room, (d) how did the experience differ from being inside a real room and (e) could they determine what the room would be like if completed according to the plan presented in the CAVE. It was not certain that the patients would understand the phrase “virtual reality” and thus the phrase “being inside a three dimensional picture” or a similar expression was used in questions regarding the CAVE.</p><p>The nurses were interviewed by a researcher with nursing experience and education, but not by the same interviewer who interviewed the patients. The nurses’ interviews in the CAVE comprised the following topics: the quality of the room in terms of (a) performing nursing tasks and procedures, (b) the expected influence on patients’ self-functioning and (c) the pleasantness of the room. Questions about the CAVE itself were similar to those asked of the patients, with the addition that the nurses were asked whether they found the CAVE a useful tool in the design of hospital environments.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9">Analysis of the data</h3><p>Prior to the analysis, all audio recordings were transcribed. The comments made in the actual ward were categorised according to the issues to which they referred. Categorising and annotating the transcript was done with the qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti.</p><p>The first categorisation was made according to the topics presented to the participants by the interviewer. Additional categories were created when a discussed topic did not fit to an existing category. In the second phase, the participants’ opinions were examined, and categories were created for different types of explanations.</p><p>After categorising the data from the interviews in the actual wards, the interviews performed in the CAVE were also categorised. We examined whether the categories found in the actual ward interviews could also be found in the data collected in the CAVE. Then comments made in the actual hospital wards were categorised according to whether they referred to (1) a feature, which can be evaluated in the CAVE, (2) a feature, which cannot be evaluated in the CAVE or (3) a feature for which evaluation in the CAVE is not certain.</p><p>The interviews in the CAVE were also used to examine instances of respondents reporting some aspects of the environment that could not be observed correctly or reliably in the CAVE or where they were uncertain about their observations. Whether these uncertainties were due to the technical features of the CAVE was also considered. Furthermore, interview data were used to examine respondents’ opinions regarding the CAVE itself.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec10"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec10-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec10">Results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content"><p>The following results are presented such that the opinion data collected on the actual wards is contrasted with the discussions in the CAVE and to the technical features of the CAVE.

The issues that they commented on are listed. Second, we discuss whether or not these same issues were commented on also by the participants in the CAVE. Possible reasons for differences (or a lack of differences) between these two sessions (actual wards vs. CAVE) are discussed. The third section of the results tells about any uncertainties expressed by the participants in regard to the observations in the CAVE. These uncertainties were taken into consideration when interpreting what can and cannot be evaluated with the CAVE.

For example, the respondents were asked “What do you like about the colours of this room?” and a typical reply was that the colours did or did not please them. The question was categorised as “colour”, while patients’ answers were summarised with the labels “pleasant/unpleasant”. Categories were also formulated for explanations that referred to some type of behaviour, such as, moving with assistive equipment, helping the patient to move, watching TV or reading or to some type of feature in the environment.</p><p>Some categories overlapped with each other. These are indicated where applicable below the subject categories in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab2">2</a>. For example, the respondents were asked whether they regarded environments as beautiful or aesthetic, and the answers were explained in terms of colours, forms, sizes and window view, which were also already separate subject categories.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Comparing discussion on the wards to discussion in CAVE</h3><p>The second column of Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab2">2</a> indicates whether the subject or the explanation related to the subject was discussed in the CAVE. Air conditioning, temperature and noises were most likely not discussed in the CAVE because, unlike on the wards, they were stable and relatively pleasant or non-disturbing. Also, on the wards, high door sills inhibited leaving rooms independently with a wheelchair, and one patient reckoned that thicker grab bars would have been better but these issues were not discussed in the CAVE. A lack of discussion regarding the thickness of grab bars or door sills in the CAVE might have been a coincidence or due to the fact that the respondents could not feel the thickness of bars or come in contact with the door sills.</p><p>Respondents commented in detail on various features in the CAVE environment, for example, window view; location of equipment, supplies and materials and sufficiency of living and workspace. It is noteworthy that end-users also made evaluations on issues that could not be or were not controlled and modelled with the CAVE. One patient evaluated the CAVE’s floor, i.e. the bottom screen, by stating that it was not slippery. Also, even though virtual patients were not modelled in the rooms, the possible distraction or good company of other patients was evaluated on the basis of bed arrangements. In other words, they were able to imagine how a certain bed arrangement enables positive discussions or causes disturbance when residing in a hospital room.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13">Uncertainties of observations in the CAVE</h3><p>The third column of Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab2">2</a> indicates whether the respondents reported that some issues could not be observed with certainty in the CAVE. In a few situations, patients mentioned that they were not sure about the sizes and distances in the CAVE. One patient explained that the correct height of a toilet seat is relevant for easy use of a toilet and commented that this could not be determined in the CAVE. Another patient said that he could not determine whether from his position the distance to the modelled wall is one metre or two metres. However, he added that he could determine the form of the modelled room.</p><p>There were a few situations in which the nurses were not sure if there was enough room for the patient to move or to help the patient. It is hard to determine whether these uncertainties might as well have occurred in a real built environment. To illustrate these cases the comments, translated from Finnish, are presented in the following:</p><p>“There is space under the sink and the height is hard to estimate when thinking of a patient with a wheelchair.”</p><p>“The door of the toilet, I’m not sure if it is wide enough. Perhaps you can go there with a wheelchair, I guess so.”</p><p>“I do not know how to look at the width of the door, if it is wide enough.” [For helping patients.]</p><p>All nurses said that it was easy to perceive the size of the modelled room in the CAVE. However, one nurse was not sure whether the USA-type patient room model was bigger than the one-patient room designed for the new ward even though in terms of square meters the American model was clearly bigger (29.2 vs. 17 m<sup>2</sup>). Another nurse was not sure about the size of room presented in the CAVE when compared to the rooms on the wards. These uncertainties could have been coincidences, due to colours and furniture sizes or due to the technical features of the CAVE.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Contrasting opinion data to CAVE: what can and cannot be evaluated</h3><p>The fourth column of Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab2">2</a> indicates whether a topic discussed in the actual environment could be evaluated with the CAVE, given the technical features of the CAVE. As only a visual presentation was created, no evaluation could be made of temperature, air conditioning and noises.</p><p>Issues were identified from the results regarding room size, furniture and moving around in the hospital environment, which could not be perfectly evaluated with the CAVE. On the wards on several occasions study participants based their evaluations on experiences associated with the physical supports and obstacles and their influence on body positions and ability to move one’s body. For example, being able to reach and brace oneself against something were important for patients to be able to independently use a toilet, while nurses needed sufficient space to be able to support the patient. In the CAVE, respondents were able to evaluate the modelled bathroom based on visual information but it is questionable whether the visual evaluation is as reliable as actually trying whether there is sufficient space or, for example, sufficient and correctly situated grab bars.</p><p>Furthermore, issues relating to room size, furniture and moving might not be evaluated perfectly in the CAVE because respondents did not seem to be able to be sure of all of their observations regarding sizes as noted previously. However, we found no reason why respondents could not evaluate the relative size and location of objects in the modelled room. Therefore, it can be considered that the correct location of equipment, supplies and a TV could be evaluated in the CAVE rather well. This is to say that the end-users could say whether or not objects are roughly in the correct place in the room, though the model used was not ideal for assessing precise fittingness when considering sufficiency of space.</p><p>Respondents were able to evaluate the lighting of the modelled room on the basis of window size plus location of lights and overall ambience. However, evaluating absolute light levels is difficult in the CAVE environment. While realistic luminance values can be calculated, they could not be reproduced correctly due to the limited dynamic range and relatively low brightness of the projectors and screens. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate whether the actual absolute light level would be sufficient for performing tasks such as treatment procedures or reading. Also, on the actual hospital wards, one patient complained about a light pointing in the wrong direction thus producing an inconvenient glare that made reading difficult. In the CAVE, however, participants would not experience uncomfortable glare even when staring directly at a modelled bright lamp or the sun.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15">Experiencing the CAVE</h3><p>On the basis of respondents’ behaviour, it can be estimated that the CAVE produced a strong illusion of being inside a modelled room. One nurse bumped into the wall of the CAVE. After this participants were advised to be cautious of the walls. Also two patients tried to touch objects modelled in the CAVE. Further, two patients that sat in a chair during the interview covered their knees while they were manoeuvred with a joystick through modelled objects such as chairs and beds.</p><p>When respondents were asked whether they felt like they were inside a real room, they answered either that it felt like it or that they could imagine being inside a real room. Three reasons were given for how the virtual experience differed from that of a real room. Some respondents noticed the corners and the edges of the physical CAVE-cube, and it was noted that objects in the modelled room could not be touched. Also, as already noted earlier, one patient indicated that he was not sure about the size of the modelled room. All respondents said that they could determine what the completed room would be like if it would be built according to the plan presented in the CAVE, and all nurses perceived the CAVE as a useful tool for designing hospital environments.</p><p>Generally, the respondents had a positive stance towards the CAVE itself. All respondents expressed either that evaluating rooms in the CAVE was a positive experience or that it was not a negative experience. In moving longer distances (e.g. from one room to another) in the CAVE, some of the first respondents interviewed reported a feeling of mild dizziness. When this was noticed, respondents were told that they could shut their eyes or look away from the screens while moving from room to room.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec16"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec16-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec16">Discussion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec16-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Main findings</h3><p>The end-users evaluated the modelled rooms of the CAVE in diverse ways and made various detailed remarks. However, the sufficiency of space and room size were not always clear to the respondents. Other relevant issues that were evaluated in the actual hospital wards but which could not be evaluated with complete reliability in the CAVE were lighting, door sills and the usefulness and correct location of grab bars for patients with limited mobility. End-users perceived the modelled rooms as realistic, while the process of evaluating it was seen as a positive experience.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Methodological considerations</h3><p>In this study, the usefulness of a CAVE-type VR environment was studied by analysing how end-users evaluate actual environments and by interpreting whether these evaluations could be made in the CAVE. Intuitively, it might seem that if the VR environment is not modelled to simulate the intended environment, then the differing designs may lead to different evaluations of the two environments, which may have nothing to do with a biasing effect of the simulation. However, we did not examine whether the end-users would evaluate the two environments—virtual and real—in a similar manner but instead looked at whether the same functions and elements could be evaluated in both environments. This is to say that we were not interested in whether the participants evaluated certain features of the rooms as poor or good or functional or non-functional but rather we were interested in what types of issues they evaluated. It would have been unnecessary to compare whether the rooms in the virtual environment were evaluated, for example, as more functional than rooms in the real environment because this comparison would have told us nothing about difference between VR and real—it might have told us only about differences between the design of rooms in a virtual and a real environment. The principle of identifying what types of issues were discussed but not how they are evaluated was taken into account when categorising participants’ comments. For example, when comments like “grab bars <i>are</i> correctly situated” and “grab bars <i>are not</i> correctly situated”, the single category “correct situation of grab bars” was created.</p><p>Some of the study participants reported mild dizziness while moving longer distances in the CAVE. It is likely that these feelings were symptoms of virtual environment-induced sickness, i.e. cybersickness or simulator sickness. These symptoms are considered to be caused by a conflict between the vestibular system’s sense of movement and the visually perceived movement and/or by display and technology issues of the used VR system (LaViola <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="LaViola J (2000) A discussion of cybersickness in virtual environments. SIGCHI Bull 32(1):47–56" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR25" id="ref-link-section-d32e1976">2000</a>). For example, dizziness could have been caused by three-dimensional imaging similarly as has been found with users of head-worn displays (Häkkinen et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Häkkinen J, Takatalo J, Pölönen M, Nyman G (2006) Simulator sickness in virtual display gaming: a comparison of stereoscopic and non-stereoscopic situations. In: Proceedings of the 8th conference on Human–computer interaction with mobile devices and services—MobileHCI ‘06" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR10" id="ref-link-section-d32e1979">2006</a>). However, it is difficult to estimate with certainty to which extent the used CAVE system caused cybersickness. First, this is because, this issue was not systematically observed in our study. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the end-users were warned beforehand about nausea and were encouraged to request a break or discontinue the study whether inappropriate feelings occurred. This kind of suggestive message may have caused a negative placebo (nocebo) effect among respondents, i.e., expectation of a negative outcome may lead to an unpleasant symptom (Benedetti et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Benedetti F, Lanotte M, Lopiano L, Colloca L (2007) When words are painful: unraveling the mechanisms of the nocebo effect. Neuroscience 147(2):260–271" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d32e1982">2007</a>). In Seron et al.’s study (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Seron FJ, Gutierrez D, Magallon JA, Sobreviela EJ, Gutierrez JA (2004) A CAVE-like environment as a tool for full-size train design. Virtual Real 7(2):82–93" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR14" id="ref-link-section-d32e1985">2004</a>), not one of 600 persons who visited the CAVE felt any motion sickness. Their CAVE was, however, implemented with a different technique to ours.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Strengths of the CAVE</h3><p>End-users were able to evaluate various environment-related features in the CAVE with detailed comments and they felt they could determine what the completed room would be like. Thus, it clearly seems that the VR system used worked as a tool for end-user participation in the hospital design process. Also noteworthy is the apparent high level of illusion that was perceived by the end-users. On the basis of their behaviour and comments, the study participants seemed to feel as if they were in a real hospital room.</p><p>Furthermore, CAVE can be regarded as useful since the overall study process seemed to convince the design team of the soon-to-be completed ward. On the basis of the end-user feedback collected during the study, concrete changes were made to the on-going hospital construction project plans. The one-patient room and the two-patient rooms of the new hospital ward were made bigger, while the couple of rooms that followed roughly the Norrtälje’s model and the American-type patient room were included into the plans for the new building.</p><p>The benefits of the CAVE over a physical mock-up have been discussed in previous studies. It has been estimated that the use of CAVE-based virtual modelling is cost-effective when compared to the use of physical full-scale mock-ups. Another benefit of the CAVE is the possibility for interactivity i.e. the modelled room can be adjusted while evaluating the environment (Dunston et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Dunston P, Arns L, McGlothlin J (2007) An immersive virtual reality mock-up for design review of hospital patient rooms. In: 7th International Conference on Construction Applications of Virtual Reality" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR8" id="ref-link-section-d32e2000">2007</a>; Seron et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Seron FJ, Gutierrez D, Magallon JA, Sobreviela EJ, Gutierrez JA (2004) A CAVE-like environment as a tool for full-size train design.

Also, it has been noted that the digital virtual model can be stored more easily than the physical mock-up (Seron et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Seron FJ, Gutierrez D, Magallon JA, Sobreviela EJ, Gutierrez JA (2004) A CAVE-like environment as a tool for full-size train design.

As a result, in our opinion, a benefit of the VR model is that it could be used during to the whole life cycle of the patient room, for re-evaluating and developing the room. This would enable better adaptation to future technological advances and changes in patient profiles that may affect the current criteria for a good quality patient room.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Limitations of and suggested improvements for the CAVE</h3><p>During this study, some limitations in the used CAVE system were found. Some issues that were evaluated in the actual hospital wards could not be evaluated to the same extent in the CAVE. Key limitations and suggested improvements are presented in brief in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#Tab3">3</a>.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 Identified limitations in the VR model used and possible solutions</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x/tables/3"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                        <p>It is probably not necessary that the end-users evaluate some of the features that could not be evaluated in the CAVE, such as temperature, air circulation and noise. Patients and nurses are likely to be content if the air conditioning works and if there is a minimal amount of unwanted voices or changes in the temperature. These goals are more likely to be achieved with professional know-how than with end-user participation. However, adding voices to the virtual environment might increase the level of realism and immersion. The infrastructural features of the CAVE enable this. Hospital voices were used in the virtual hospital environment presented by Dunston et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Dunston P, Arns L, McGlothlin J (2007) An immersive virtual reality mock-up for design review of hospital patient rooms. In: 7th International Conference on Construction Applications of Virtual Reality" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR8" id="ref-link-section-d32e2123">2007</a>).</p><p>Evaluating lights in the CAVE can be considered problematic as it was not possible to test whether or not the lights would have projected in the right directions so that they would produce sufficient luminance levels without causing unpleasant glare. The planned level of luminescence could be simulated to some extent even with limited brightness levels by adding a glow around an object. The glow would hinder the viewer’s ability to see clearly around the bright object, as would be expected in the real world. Simple empirical lens flare models could be sufficient and more sophisticated models, which are based on examinations of physiological causes of glare in human vision, have been developed (Spence et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Spence G, Shirley P, Zimmerman K, Greenberg D (1995) Physically based glare effects for digital images. In: Proceedings of the 22nd annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR15" id="ref-link-section-d32e2129">1995</a>). However, it is not clear how well these models would work in the CAVE. Moreover, it is noteworthy that simulated glare would not cause reflections on real-world objects brought to the CAVE. Thus, to test whether the lights would project a distracting glare that would inhibit, say, reading a newspaper, that newspaper would have to be modelled in the VR environment. Further, simulated bright lamps may not induce irritation or energising effects to the same extent as real-world lights. For example, with sophisticated radiosity models, a virtual sunlit room may indeed look correct in CAVE, but ultimately the physiological response is different because the light is not truly as bright as it should be.</p><p>Not being able to touch the modelled objects in the CAVE was a limitation since on the actual hospital wards, end-users evaluated environments on the basis of being able to touch or hold features and to brace against things. Touch-based VR systems have been developed (Wall and Brewster <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Wall S, Brewster S (2006) Editorial: design of haptic user-interfaces and applications. Virtual Real 9(2–3):95–96" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d32e2135">2006</a>); however, it is questionable as to how they would be implemented for this use in the CAVE and whether these systems could be developed to hold the weight of the patients.</p><p>Not being able to brace oneself against the modelled objects can be considered a major problem especially for evaluating toilets. On the wards, toilets were often evaluated in terms of whether the grab bars were correctly situated. To overcome this problem, physically constructed objects (e.g. a toilet seat and grab bars) should be used in addition to the VR model. Incorporating these into the CAVE room would create additional effort during the evaluation, as moving longer distances in the modelled environment would require the physical objects to be moved in and out of the CAVE scene. Another possibility would be then to recognise the issues for which the touch-based feedback is important and to test these separately from the CAVE sessions.</p><p>End-users were sometimes uncertain about the distances and sizes in the modelled rooms. A similar observation was made in a study by Fröst and Warren (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Fröst P, Warren P (2000) Virtual reality used in a collaborative architectural design process. In: Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Visualisation " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x#ref-CR9" id="ref-link-section-d32e2144">2000</a>). In their study, end-users did not always trust the CAVE-based visualisation to present distances and relied sometimes on more conventional tools, drawings and a ruler, for certainty. The authors (Fröst and Warren <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Fröst P, Warren P (2000) Virtual reality used in a collaborative architectural design process.

Additionally, since our study participants were concerned as to whether or not there was sufficient space in the rooms for patients to move, for nurses to work, and for assistive equipment such as wheel chairs, these elements could be added to VR models.</p><p>It is possible that end-users were unsure about sizes because actually two size-related cues were present in the CAVE: the modelled visualisation and the physical corners of the CAVE-cube.</p><p>As noted earlier, interactivity is one of the advantages of virtual modelling. In a previous study, interactive CAVE-type VR system was used in collaborative hospital environment design (Dunston et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Dunston P, Arns L, McGlothlin J (2007) An immersive virtual reality mock-up for design review of hospital patient rooms.

However, in our virtual model, this was not done. This was due to time and work-force restrains. Time-consuming programming is a problem that has been discussed by Dunston et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Dunston P, Arns L, McGlothlin J (2007) An immersive virtual reality mock-up for design review of hospital patient rooms.

Healthcare practitioners interviewed for the study reckoned that time-consuming implementation is the prime limiting factor that prevents project teams for new hospitals from investing in VR presentations.</p><p>In the project presented here, however, no programming was required because sufficient features were provided by commercial software. The time spent on modelling a room depended on the source material. Equipped with reusable components like hospital beds and other furniture, a room of reasonable quality could be produced in about a week from CAD models and in a couple of weeks from scratch by one person who was familiar with the process.</p><p>Modelling hospital rooms with more uncommon and complicated equipment or items, such as operating tables, would have been more time-consuming. Therefore, there is validity in Dunston et al.’s (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Dunston P, Arns L, McGlothlin J (2007) An immersive virtual reality mock-up for design review of hospital patient rooms.

They also propose a central repository where the data can be stored, used and enhanced.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec21"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec21-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec21">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec21-content"><p>This paper demonstrates that the CAVE clearly works in harnessing the end-users’ perspective and know-how in the collaborative design of patient rooms. Most issues evaluated in the actual wards could also be evaluated in the VR environment, and the overall process had an influence on the design of new wards. Promising results on the use of VR in the design collaboration have also been obtained from previous studies. Thus, it can be argued that VR systems might contribute to a transition from an expert-based hospital design process to a more democratic and user-based one. However, by contrasting end-users opinion data with the used VR model some limitations were noticed and suggestions made. Most importantly, for an even better VR environment, the end-users should be able to summon virtual patients, assistive equipment and nurses into the modelled rooms. These virtual items and figures should be easily manoeuvred to see whether or not there is enough space in different parts of the room.</p><p>In addition to evaluating the use of CAVE for collaborative patient room design, our study carries a further insight. What is needed from a VR system can be determined by studying how end-users evaluate actual environments. This can be done qualitatively, so that end-users may freely express themselves, that is, not with scales and numerical measures that may restrict end-users to the categories and dichotomies presented by the researchers. We label this method as <i>the end-user opinion contrasting method for virtual environments</i>. We offer it as a practical means for industry when considering the purchase of a VR system for end-user assisted design projects. By first studying how end-users evaluate real environments, it becomes clearer what kind of VR model is needed to enable evaluations of relevant issues. For example, if tangibility and touch are important in the overall collaborative design process, some type of augmented virtuality, in which real-world objects are merged into the virtual theatre, or a physical mock-up instead of virtual one could be considered.</p><p>Positive feedback from our partners is leading towards a continuation project. The hospital extension project in Seinäjoki, Finland, from which part of the patient room designs originated, is interested in further developing the collaborative hospital design process. The plan is to extend the use of CAVE from patient room design to the collaborative design of other hospital premises, such as emergency rooms.</p></div></div></section>
