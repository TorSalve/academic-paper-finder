The system produced, Reach-back Enabling Multiple Objective Team-working Environment (REMOTE), was included in an initial study evaluating potential novel command technologies for distributed team working, and more detail can be found in the resulting QinetiQ technical report (Clarke et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Clarke H, Goillau P, Stockdale R (2003) Distributed teamworking experiment.

The customer for this work was the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), who are, like other national defence departments (e.g. the United States Department of Defense), looking at ‘command posts of the future’. Command posts are responsible for decision-making, the co-ordination of manoeuvres, and issuing orders to troops, and are made up of commanders with an often-substantial support staff. Such large command posts are difficult to deploy, especially in proximity to a battlefield—not the safest place to be—and yet, there are many advantages in doing so for rapid and efficient decision-making. As a result, the idea of using technology to combine a small mobile group with all the distributed resources they need—especially experienced people, who should not be risked by putting them close to combat—has become an attractive one. This produces a geographically distributed team.</p><p>Much research was carried out into distributed team working in the much broader context of the globalisation of organisations. The issues and problems are comparatively well known as a result, and mostly arise from the absence of spatial co-location. Co-location has many advantages, especially for tightly coupled synchronous interaction (Olson et al. 1992; Covi et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Covi LM, Olson JS, Rocco E, Miller WJ, Allie P (1998) A Room of your own: what do we learn about support of teamwork from assessing teams in dedicated project rooms.

A shared local context, including shared time frame and many outside events, supports easy socialising, building trust and mutual understanding (Bradner and Mark <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Bradner E, Mark G (2002) Why distance matters: effects on cooperation, persuasion and deception.

Personal identities are known and can be taken into account—including cultural and language differences—and peripheral interactions can be seen in passing and interpreted. Mutual awareness is known to be central to collaborative working (Steed and Tromp <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Steed A, Tromp J (1997) “Experiences with the Evaluation of CVE Applications”.

It was estimated that more than 65% of the information exchanged during a face-to-face interaction is expressed through these largely non-verbal mechanisms (Argyle <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1988" title="Argyle M (1988) Bodily Communication. Methuen, New York" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d59682e376">1988</a>), which are mainly analogue, continuous and support subtle distinctions and nuances. Flowing conversation depends on many such channels for ‘back-channel‘ regulation and successful turn taking (Cassell et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Cassell J, Nakano Y, Bickmore T, Sidner C, Rich C (2001) “Non-Verbal Cues for Discourse Structure”.

Moreover, they play important roles in establishing a common frame of reference both for concepts and objects, e.g. through deictic gestures such as pointing. This in turn relies on the spatiality of such references—people and objects are located in a common space. In multi-person meetings, such channels can also be used to express or judge the reaction of other participants to the current speaker. Finally, co-location minimises communication delays.</p><p>This analysis has produced a demand for ‘virtual co-location’ (VCL)—a loosely defined concept, which can be taken to mean capturing some or all of the characteristics of co-location for participants not actually co-located, using a variety of information and communication technologies: audio, video and computer-based. The basis for the study reported here was the hypothesis that some of the characteristics of co-location that are difficult to support through mechanisms such as email, electronic chat, video-conferencing and groupware, could be supported through a collaborative virtual environment (CVE; Churchill and Snowdon <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Churchill E, Snowdon D (1998) Collaborative virtual environments: an introductory review of issues and systems.

Here, a multi-user 3D graphically realised shared virtual space would play some of the role of shared physical space through the sense of <i>physical presence</i>—the feeling of being physically located in the virtual space—which with multiple users might then produce a feeling of physical co-location.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Study methodology</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><p>There are known methodological problems in evaluating CVEs (Steed and Tromp <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Steed A, Tromp J (1997) “Experiences with the Evaluation of CVE Applications”.

The geographic distribution and number of users makes conducting proper controlled experiments very difficult, while the prototypical nature of applications usually makes it infeasibly expensive in time and other resources to create different experimental conditions. These constraints are particularly acute where the task involved is unpredictably structured and has an extended duration, as in military operations (note that Steed and Tromp considered video-conferencing and booking holidays as their applications, both much less problematic than military operations).</p><p>In addition, studies involving military teams are inevitably hard to setup. Not only is it inconceivable that wholly novel approaches would be tried in a live situation, even their use in official exercises would require a degree of maturity in the technology and acceptance by the prospective users still a long way from being achieved.</p><p>Given that this work involved an initial study, or ‘proof of concept’, participant numbers were bound to be too small to adopt a rigorous quantitative approach, forcing a qualitative and exploratory stance. Nevertheless, qualitative approaches are well established in HCI work, where they are seen as fundamental to user-centred design, drawing on cognitive and social psychology and ethnography (Hughes et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Hughes J, King V, Rodden T, Anderson H (1995) The role of ethnography in interactive systems design. ACM Interact 2 (2):56–65" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR19" id="ref-link-section-d59682e407">1995</a>). Qualitative methods are also widely used in the broader field of Information Systems (Myers and Avison <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Myers MD, Avison DE (eds) (2002) Qualitative research in information systems: a Reader. Sage Publications, London" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d59682e410">2002</a>).</p><p>The qualitative technique adopted was that of the exploratory case study. This refers to the collection and presentation of detailed information about a particular participant or small group, frequently including the accounts of subjects themselves (Sechrest et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Sechrest L, Stewart M, Stickle T, Sidani S (1996) Effective and persuasive case studies.

The case study technique gives special attention to completeness in observation, reconstruction, and analysis of the cases under study and deals with a situation in which there are many more variables of interest than there are data points. This contrasts with controlled experiments in which there are typically several orders of magnitude more data points than variables. A case study is more concerned with establishing variables and questions for future research than with final, generalisable conclusions, but it can also be seen as an individual iteration in a larger process of user-centred design, with particular relevance to use-in-context and interface and interaction issues (Shneiderman <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1992" title="Shneiderman B (1992) Designing the user interface: Strategies for effective human-computer interaction, 2nd edn. Addison-Wesley, Reading" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR26" id="ref-link-section-d59682e419">1992</a>). This is particularly true where a case study can legitimately be categorised as one involving ‘typical’ users carrying out a ‘typical’ task.</p><p>Two teams of four participants made up of ex-service personnel were made available. These were experienced personnel who had carried out such operations in their military careers and could therefore be regarded as typical of the user group being targeted. However, these participants were only available for the week-long study in March 2003 itself, and not for prior development of the user requirements. Here, experience of past studies in other military domains and some comment from a military link officer were the only input. The case study approach is familiar to these users and is widelyused within the military environment since it is a basic training method and the framework for military exercises. One can therefore have some confidence in the typicality of the scenarios used and their relevance to the evaluation of the technology.</p><p>As we have commented, it was often found infeasible in evaluating CVEs to create different experimental conditions. However, it was possible to do this for the study being discussed given that the participants were available for a week, rather than the shorter times of some other studies (Steed and Tromp <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Steed A, Tromp J (1997) “Experiences with the Evaluation of CVE Applications”.

An initial view was taken that since groupware offers the most mature technology for distributed teams, this should form the base-line condition for the study. The package GROOVE Workspace (Groove-Networks <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Groove-Networks (2002) Groove Workspace &#xA;                    http://www.groove.net&#xA;                    &#xA;                  " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR18" id="ref-link-section-d59682e431">2002</a>) was the groupware used. Two further experimental conditions were then added, as enhancements to, not replacements for, groupware: the addition of video-conferencing, using CUSeeMe (CUSeeMee-Networks <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="CUSeeMe-Networks (2001) CUSeeMe. &#xA;                    http://ic2.cuseeme.com/&#xA;                    &#xA;                  " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR10" id="ref-link-section-d59682e434">2001</a>), and the addition of a CVE. It was hoped in this way to capture differential benefits of the second and third experimental conditions. Thus it was a fundamental requirement for the CVE that it interface with the chosen groupware platforms and support the invocation of groupware components from within it.</p><p>Finally, it is important to remember that the target users are very unlikely to be sophisticated users of IT and are used to coordinating activity at a distance by voice only, using radio. They are, however, also used to working in a disciplined style controlled by standard operating procedures (SOPs). SOPs are detailed written instructions to be routinely followed so as to achieve uniformity in the performance of a specific function. They are used in many large organisations, especially, where the consequences of procedural errors can be very serious, as for example in military operations, and experienced personnel, such as those in the current study, are familiar with the relevant SOPs and will apply them appropriately under case-study conditions.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">The construction of REMOTE</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><p>The experimental constraints were the starting point for the requirements of the REMOTE software. Objects spatially located within the CVE were to be used as a means of invoking external applications such as email, web browser and groupware components. A degree of fidelity to the physical environment was required—the virtual world should look something like a command post and include objects such as a <i>bird table</i> (i.e. large table for the display of maps etc.) that would be the central feature in a real command post. It was decided that a central room with other rooms leading off would be included, with each room containing a particular piece of functionality.

All of these were capable of supporting a client–server architecture, of handling a 3D graphical world, and of importing 3D models from widely available modelling packages such as 3ds max (DISCREET: http://www.discreet.com/support/max/). Atmosphere was, however, felt to have a rather low frame-rate and a very limited API for adding new behaviours, only offering JavaScript. It was not clear that it would be feasible to call other applications from within it, such as GROOVE, as required.</p><p>The standard API for the Unreal Tournament engine was limited to its proprietary Unreal Script, and while the Gamebots (Kaminka et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Kaminka GA, Veloso M, Schaffer S, Sollitto C, Adobbati R, Marshal AN, Scholer AS, Tejada S (2002) GameBots: the ever-challenging multi-agent research test-bed.

However, WildTangent has a very open API supporting Visual C, Visual Basic or Java (though the version used required the Microsoft JVM, not updated past Java 1.1.4), and is easy to integrate into web browsers, unlike Unreal. While Unreal uses OpenGL as its underlying library, and is thus multi-platform, WildTangent sits on DirectX and is Windows-specific, but this was not seen as an issue for a proof-of-concept system that was intended to run under Windows. In any case, this close relationship with DirectX makes WildTangent fast, and as it handles all of the graphics, there is little speed penalty in using Java as a framework around it with the accompanying benefits of a modern web-oriented language. Thus, WildTangent was chosen as the development platform and Java was used to access its facilities.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Embodiment and identity</h3><p>In considering what user representation to support within REMOTE, certain basic considerations were important. User representations— avatars <sup><a href="#Fn1"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>—are added to a CVE to meet six generic requirements, as proposed by Pandzic et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Pandzic I, Lee E, Magnenat Thalmann N, Capin T, Thalmann D (1997) A flexible architecture for Virtual Humans, in Networked Collaborative Virtual Environments. Comput Graph Forum vol 16, Issue 3, Conference Issue" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR24" id="ref-link-section-d59682e501">1997</a>): (1) <i>Perception</i> allows a user to register the presence of others, and (2) <i>localization</i> to see where in the environment they are. (3) <i>Identification</i> is then the ability to know who they are. These three capabilities are basic but can be met by fairly crude graphical representations.</p><p>A further three capabilities require more sophisticated representations. (4) <i>Visualisation of interest focus</i> usually requires the representation of gaze direction, most obviously through a user representation with eyes, whether realistic, as in a humanoid figure for example or iconic, such as a personal emblem or object. This is also achievable using a sensor beam as in virtual robots. (5) <i>Visualisation of actions</i> can only occur if the avatar has the ability to carry out actions, using some form of end-effector, in robot terminology. This could be a robot gripper, or arms and legs, but again, could also be represented simply by extending a line to a manipulated object, or through a 3D cursor or virtual hand grasping the object. (6) Avatar <i>Communication</i> poses the heaviest requirement—in real life, as already argued above, it is supported by gesture, posture, facial expression and vocal characteristics. Creating an expressive avatar requires a relatively sophisticated representation, which may then create a problem for the user who has to manipulate this expressive repertoire while also carrying out whatever collaborative task is at issue.</p><p>Perception, localisation and identification of course include self-knowledge too, and this depends on whether a first-person or third-person view is adopted. In the former case, the user does not see their own avatar since their position is as if they were looking through the avatar’s eyes; in the latter case, the user is positioned a little above and behind the avatar. Atmosphere and Unreal Tournament both take a first-person view (with the weapon being carried visible in Unreal), but a third-person view was selected in REMOTE. In the real world, we always have some awareness of what we look like and where our body is in relation to objects around us, and this effect of the third-person view was felt to outweigh the inconvenience of having the avatar body partially block the user’s field of vision.</p><p>A humanoid form for an avatar is not always essential, but in terms of expressiveness it has many advantages (Benford et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Benford SD, Bowers JM, Fahlen LE, Greenhalgh CM, Snowdon DN (1997) Embodiments, Avatars, clones and agents for multi-user, multi-sensory virtual worlds. Multimedia Systems 5(2):93–104" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d59682e530">1997</a>). It seemed especially relevant to REMOTE’s target users given their lack of familiarity with graphical environments. It also provided an intuitive method for displaying the service, rank and role of a particular user, significant identifiers in military organisations and especially in control rooms where commanders of all services may collaborate along with civilian or government specialists.</p><p>A natural way of identifying individuals would be to texture their face onto the face of their avatar, technically quite straightforward. The conditions of the study made this impossible, as the participants were unknown until shortly before it took place; instead the name, role and rank of the user were attached above the head of the avatar, using a billboard so that it always faced towards a viewing user, the data being gathered at logon. However, this was removed from the user’s own avatar (they know who they are) as it blocked too much of the field of view. Uniform was used to indicate service membership—camouflage for army, white shirt and dark blue trousers for navy, and light blue shirt and blue trousers for air force. Both male and female avatars were provided, the gender user-selected at logon, and figures of somewhat heroic physical proportions were produced (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig1">1</a>).

However, it was also considered important to a feeling of physical presence and realism that avatars could not walk through walls or furniture so that obstacle avoidance was required. The method of separating axes was used to determine whether or not two bounding boxes intersected. Using the data for the centre, axes and extents of the avatar’s box and for the bounding box of the object to be tested, classical algorithms to test if two boxes have an intersection as described in Eberly (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Eberly DH (2001) 3D Game Engine Design.

If they do collide, then the velocity of the avatar is reduced to zero and the position is updated accordingly.</p><p>Latency is always an issue in a CVE, and if the position of an avatar is updated only on coordinates from the server, latency effects can produce a very jerky animation. Dead-reckoning can be used to improve this situation by making a local prediction in the client about where an avatar is likely to move, moving towards that point and updating with the incoming coordinates from the server. Thus, dead reckoning consists of two parts prediction and convergence (Singhal and Zyda <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Singhal S, Zyda, M (1999) Networked Virtual Environments, Siggraph Series.

Prediction is the way the entity’s current state is computed based on previously received update packets, while convergence defines how the object’s position and trajectory is corrected as in the following equation: </p><div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$ {\text{pred}}.{\text{pos}}\;{\text{after}}\;t\,{\text{seconds}} = {\text{pos}}\, + \,{\text{velocity}} \times t $$</span></div></div><p>The difference between the real position and the predicted position is next computed and a new path is calculated, which is used in the convergence algorithm. Finally, a point in the future is selected on the new predicted path, and the navigation is updated accordingly. Several techniques were proposed (Singhal and Zydah 1999), although a linear convergence (using velocity but not acceleration) was selected for REMOTE, because latency was not thought to be a big problem in the setup of this study given that it ran on a LAN in two neighbouring rooms.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Interacting with other applications</h3><p>As discussed above, the ability of the CVE to interact with other applications was a fundamental requirement.

To make this visible to the user, the bounding box was rendered as partially opaque on intersection—as in the top left component of Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig3">3</a>, in which the Board object in the Pictures room was intersected, bringing up the GROOVE picture seen bottom right in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig3">3</a>. When the avatar leaves the bounding box, the application is closed, and a delay factor was incorporated to prevent rapid zigzags between opening and closing. Interactions with another user were initiated by approaching that user’s avatar, and such interactions were limited to one-to-one. The main purpose here was to invoke Netalk to allow voice interaction between two users.

The server side handles the data received from the clients, that is positions and actions of the avatar and it replicates the data to the clients so that the all clients have the data regarding the other users’ avatars. To handle communication between the server and the clients, the <i>Observer-Subject</i> Pattern was used, updating information when a message is received by the listener (as seen in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig4">4</a>). This runs in a separate thread.</p><p>On the client side (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig4">4</a>), several subcomponents were developed to handle the required tasks. Object Orientation and Design Patterns (Gamma et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Gamma E, Helm R, Johnson R, Vlissides J (1996) Design patterns, Addison-Wesley Longman, Reading Massachusettsss" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d59682e858">1996</a>) are heavily used in the architecture offering support for modularity and the use of existing abstract solutions to common problems like the use of controllers (the <i>singleton</i> pattern was used to have just one instance of a class of controllers in the code). These controllers are used to handle the animation of the avatars, the network communications and the data relating to all the objects displayed in the virtual environment.</p><p>Also important was the use of the <i>command</i> pattern to link an object in the virtual environment to an action, for example, to open a GROOVE subcomponent. GROOVE is itself a set of subcomponents, and as Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Tab1">1</a> shows, four of these— sketchpad, files, notepad and picture—were invoked by an avatar approach to the relevant object. This was handled by the GROOVE Server: the object has an associated message, which is sent to the server, creating a link between object and GROOVE subcomponent. A similar mechanism was used to open other Windows applications using the application server, and an editable XML file was used to specify the repertoire of connections making the system easily extensible.</p><p>Another external program is a Logger Server, used to store copies of messages so that a history of the interactions between avatars and objects can be maintained. This was also configurable via XML. The login is used to enter the profile of the user and allows a user to choose their sex (male, female), their service, their role and their rank. The selected profile is used to generate an avatar in the appropriate uniform and the label above the avatar’s head.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec8"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec8-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec8">Study and results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"><p>As already mentioned, the study involving the use of REMOTE ran in March 2003 and involved two teams of four ex-military personnel, each forming a HQ. A team contained a Chief of Staff (COS), an Intelligence coordinator (J2), Operations controller (J3) and Logistics controller (J4). These are standard and well-understood HQ roles. Each team was located in a separate room but shared the same LAN. No attempt was made to simulate latency, bandwidth constraints or other WAN conditions.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Use of scenarios</h3><p>The scenarios were all set within the context of the UN peace-keeping operation in the fictitious country of New Albion, an island archipelago in the North Atlantic, approximately 600 km to the west of UK. New Albion comprises three ethnically divided provinces: Wessex (Angle), Siluria (Celtic) and Devonia (Celtic). After 10 years of bitter civil war, the UN is invited to intervene to monitor a lasting ceasefire; however, UN intervention fails through lack of a clear mandate and other factors. A new ceasefire is brokered and NATO agrees to intervene with New Albion consent and a revised UN mandate. The US, UK and France each agree to send Divisional sized forces (NAFOR). Despite the ‘ceasefire’ there is an operationally urgent need to get new forces on the ground as quickly as possible. The UK contributes a framework Multi-National Divisional HQ, some Divisional troops, a Mechanised Brigade and an embarked Commando Brigade.</p><p>The background information remained the same throughout all three conditions, minimising the additional read-in time each day and allowing more time for planning. Each of the three experimental conditions described above in Sect. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Sec2">2</a> was introduced by a new task set within the overall scenario. For condition 1, this was to organise the relief of the commando brigade by the incoming mechanical brigade; for condition 2 to deploy forces to secure a town in which ‘ethnic cleansing’ was threatening; for condition 3 to evacuate threatened settlers from the town back to their ethnic home area and protect those staying on. The output from each scenario was a plan briefing in which a remotely situated representative Commander was presented with potential courses of action (COA). Scenarios were such that they deliberately forced collaboration between HQs —for example, sources of information were placed at different levels within each HQ. A control cell ran the simulation, generating military and political events.</p><p>The maintenance of Situational Awareness (SA) is usually ranked among the most important tasks for all command post team members (Taylor <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Taylor RM (1990) Situational awareness rating technique (SART): the development of a tool for aircrew systems design.

A widely (though not universally) accepted definition is that of (Endsley <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Endsley MR (1995) Toward a theory of situation awareness in dynamic systems.

Military planning in command posts is naturally hierarchical (for example, strategic, tactical or operational), and in the scenario used, planning invariably commenced with one HQ having better higher-level SA while the other would have better lower-level SA. This was achieved by having one HQ ‘on the ground’ operating at the tactical level and the other working at the operational level out of the area.</p><p>The study used a <i>within groups</i> (related, same-subject) design (Clarke et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Clarke H, Goillau P, Stockdale R (2003) Distributed teamworking experiment. QinetiQ May 2003, Malvern" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR8" id="ref-link-section-d59682e911">2003</a>) so that all subjects performed all conditions: GROOVE alone, GROOVE + CUSeeMe and the GROOVE + REMOTE. The constraints on the availability of participants, and the resources available, made this a most feasible approach. There are known difficulties with this design: for example, there can be a learning effect from one condition to the next and a potential order effect where performance either improves as a result of practice and familiarity or degrades because of fatigue or boredom. Changing the scenario and the role of the team members between the conditions can counterbalance some of these effects. However, this needs to be taken into account when analysing the results and is discussed in Sect. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Sec12">4.4</a> below.</p><p>In the 5-day programme, each four-person team spent the first day separately carrying out non-technology-based team-building exercises, to avoid an increasing team familiarity and cohesion among the co-located participants impacting the study. During the second day, familiarisation with GROOVE was carried out. Then one condition was run on each day, with the last part of days 3 and 4 spent on training in CUSeeMe and REMOTE, respectively. The last part of day 5 was used to complete the questionnaires discussed below and for a debrief.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Data collection and analysis</h3><p>Data was collected by observations made during each experimental condition and through questionnaires completed after each experimental condition, see Appendix 1. Two observers were present in each team room and used an observational ‘crib sheet’ as a guide—see Appendix 3. Observations covered: the human factors issues associated with working in a distributed command environment; how the tools supported the VCL concept through team and task work; the effects of the different tools on local and distributed team interactions; the effect of the tools on the military task; difficulties in using the tools. A set of categories was developed to allow observations to be grouped and this can be seen in Appendix 4. The debrief was carried out using the prompt sheet in Appendix 2.</p><p>Three questionnaires were used, containing a 7 point Likert rating scale and completed electronically. The three questionnaires covered: aspects of distributed and collaborative team working effectiveness; the degree to which the collaborative technologies meet Virtual Co-Location (VCL) requirements; and aspects of the collaborative technologies including general comments/strengths/weaknesses/missing features, and tool design aspects and the effect of the collaborative technologies on co-located team working. Subjects were invited to add any comment they wished after any question. The debrief followed the questionnaires and was structured around five ‘open’ questions and associated prompts as seen in Appendix 2.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Results summary</h3><p>The averaged responses to the VCL requirements questionnaire, which was composed of 41 statements each with a 7-point Disagree/Agree response scale, are shown as graphical profiles in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig5">5</a>. There was considerable variation in responses across individual questions, of which all but two—questions 2 and 9—were posed positively (i.e. higher score = better). Overall, the GROOVE + CUSeeMe condition achieved higher ‘agreement’ ratings than did the GROOVE alone condition, which in turn was rated higher than the GROOVE + REMOTE condition. Overall means across all conditions and participants were 4.87 (GROOVE + CUSeeMe), 4.12 (GROOVE alone) and 3.38 (GROOVE + REMOTE). Separating these profiles by team showed that team 1 rated GROOVE alone and GROOVE + CUSeeMe similarly to team 2.

They would most often turn away from their workstations to hold such meetings and as a result, message alerts and calls from team 1 would be missed. Team 2 members also stood up to leave their workstations and temporarily gather around other members’ workstations to discuss information far more than team 1 members. A consequence of this was that team 1 members were frequently unable to contact team 2 members and expressed a great deal of frustration. REMOTE had no facility to signal when such own-team meetings were taking place and thus contributed to rather than relieving team 1’s frustration.</p><p>REMOTE’s best scores related to Q11 (“The software enabled me to rapidly exchange key information with another individual on a one-to-one basis”.) and to Q21 (“The software enabled all members of the team to undertake their roles and responsibilities”) strongly suggesting that the overall critical response was not due to functional incapability or fragile implementation, but rather to the basic design decisions made. Its worst scores relate to Q18 (“The software effectively supported social interaction [e.g. chatting or interacting separate to the work task] with another individual on a one-to-one basis”.) and Q19 (“The software effectively supported social interaction with several other team members at the same time.”), reflecting the constraint of one-to-one communication only.</p><p>In terms of meeting distributed team members as easily as co-located members, REMOTE was overall considered better at supporting this than GROOVE, but was considered worse than CUSeeMe. This was due to an exceptionally high rating by team 2, which judged REMOTE superior to both GROOVE and CUSeeMe in this regard. Team 2 rated REMOTE on a par with CUSeeMe, however, in its ability to support a sense of shared meeting space.</p><p>The ranking between the software of the three conditions shown in these subjective scales is reflected in the participants’ written questionnaire comments, and observers’ observations. The two other questionnaires alternated positive and negative questions, so that the result profiles are less easy to visualise than the one shown, but they also gave a compatible ranking of the study conditions.</p><p>We return here to the issue raised in 4.1 above: whether there was a learning effect from one condition to the next and a potential order effect either improving performance as a result of practise and familiarity or degrading it because of fatigue or boredom, which might itself explain the ranking of the three conditions. First, we would restate that the first day included a scenario-based team task without any of the software under examination in order to minimise the effect of improving social cohesion among subjects who were new to each other. Secondly, GROOVE was in use for all three days of the experimental condition as well as in training on the second day. A positive learning effect for it as between condition 1 and condition 2 was noted in observation. However, had this effect been dominant, then one would not expect the second experimental condition to be ranked higher than the third one, as it was. If a boredom factor for GROOVE was involved, one would have expected the observation process to detect it, and it did not.</p><p>The area in which boredom and frustration may have impacted the study lay in the difference between team 1 and team 2’s work styles, and the frustration suffered by team 1 as a result discussed above. This may have been a further factor in the more critical assessment of the third experimental condition by team 1. However, both teams ranked the three experimental conditions the same, suggesting that the order effect, if present, was not decisive. In general, the observation regime acted as a control on both factors since it produced a detailed picture of action and interaction.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">User-identified problems</h3><p>The overall questionnaire results above show that the users were critical of REMOTE compared to GROOVE and CUSeeMe. The underlying problems prompting these results are brought out in user comments which were collected by the observers, made during the debrief session, and included in the questionnaires.

However, one must take into account here the inherent difficulties in supporting distributed teams with technology. The following comment is instructive, arising from a study into the use of non-CVE collaborative tools to support distributed design teams in manufacturing engineering:</p><p>“Findings from this study suggest that collaborative tools must be clearly superior to existing practices to merit the effort of deployment, adoption and subsequent use, since the burden of learning and mastering a new tool in a demanding and fast-paced engineering design environment may not outweigh the perceived benefits.” (Wierba et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Wierba EE, Finholt TA, Steves M (2001) “What have you done for me lately?” A case study of barriers to collaborative tool adoption in a manufacturing engineering setting (PDF file). At: &#xA;                    http://www.crew.umich.edu/technical_reports.htm&#xA;                    &#xA;                  " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR32" id="ref-link-section-d59682e1180">2001</a>, p1).</p><p>In a similar collaborative design environment, albeit with physically co-located teams, the technology that was most clearly valued was a printing wallboard that saved participants the time previously spent copying informal diagrams to take away (Olson and Olson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Olson GM, Olson JS (2000) Distance matters. Human Comput Interact 15:139–179" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d59682e1186">2000</a>). Here, ‘just one thing’ was added to existing and familiar technologies. Work in the field suggests that involvement of users in the design of collaborative environments—difficult to set up in military domains—plays a very important role. For example, a successful ‘collaboratory’ of space physicists (Olson and Olson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Olson GM, Olson JS (2000) Distance matters. Human Comput Interact 15:139–179" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d59682e1189">2000</a>) has involved ten major redesigns over 7 years, all involving the users. In this collaboratory, scientists organise themselves into virtual rooms of objects and remote partners to run experiments using real-time data from geographically distributed instruments, suggesting that the basic metaphor of the virtual room may play a positive role.</p><p>The key question is whether a CVE is inherently incapable of delivering clearly superior results, both to existing practice and other technological solutions such as the first two experimental conditions, or whether a different set of design decisions, together with some maturing of underlying technologies, might produce a more successful CVE. This question is related to an ongoing ‘space-versus-place’ debate within the CSCW community as summarised in (Benford et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Benford S, Greenhalgh C, Rodden T, Pycock J (2001) Collaborative Virtual Environments. Commun ACM 44(7):79–85" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#ref-CR4" id="ref-link-section-d59682e1195">2001</a>).</p><p>The arguments for the ‘space’ metaphor already outlined suggest that it is independent movement within a shared coordinate system, combined with the representation of others’ positions through avatars that allows a CVE to support social interaction. Those supporting the ‘place’ argument suggest that other important aspects of an environment beyond the provision of a shared coordinate system are responsible for supporting social interaction. We are more convinced by the potential benefits of a shared space, and here put forward lessons learned from the study on the design of such a space for distributed military command teams.</p><p>REMOTE applied a relatively naturalistic design to its virtual world, while interfacing it to applications such as groupware with a desktop metaphor. These two metaphors did not appear to marry together well for the users, and the conflict between them was sharpened by locating each application launcher in a different virtual room. Unlike the collaboratory cited above, in which an experiment is a specific activity and thus fits conceptually into a separate room, military planning requires a strong integration of different information sources from different locations.</p><p>Thus the <i>bird table</i> plays a very central role in real command posts and this was not successfully replicated in REMOTE. One user commented: “The key to digitisation is a version of the electronic bird table. Showing the same picture to all team members, and can plan concurrently”. REMOTE applied a naturalistic metaphor for physical space, this was not true of its information metaphor: “Compared to the analogue system, you have a map and notepad which you carry with you anywhere. So you shouldn’t have to go to other rooms—not realistic“. Allowing avatars to carry information sources would also make it natural to have many open simultaneously and support transfer between them—the restriction of having one tool only open at a time was felt acutely, especially.for maps, often used with other documents, and a natural focus for voice interaction. It would also have avoided queues around central resources such as in the Files Room (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig6">6</a>).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-6"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig6" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 6</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z/figures/6" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-004-0143-z/MediaObjects/s10055-004-0143-zfhb6.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-6-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-004-0143-z/MediaObjects/s10055-004-0143-zfhb6.jpg" alt="figure6" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-6-desc"><p>Avatars queuing to access the File resource</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z/figures/6" data-track-dest="link:Figure6 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div><p>The consequence of the decision to distribute information sources was a high requirement for navigation. The effort it produced for users underlines a basic difference between real and virtual spaces. In the real world, most spatial navigation in office environments is carried out at a sub-cognitive level—we walk and think, or talk, at the same time. This is not true of navigating an avatar in a desktop CVE and it is hard to conceive a navigational mechanism that would be as low in effort. But this does not mean that a 3D space is in itself a bad thing, merely that one should not try to ‘walk’ avatars about a large space with separate rooms as in REMOTE.</p><p>A further consequence of the design was that the users found it hard to locate the avatars of users with whom they wanted to interact. A ‘plan view’ was suggested as a result, and this together with some colour-coding would support easier location. A single-room design would fundamentally reduce the problem, but might then meet over-crowding problems in a command post with many more participants. Centering interaction on avatars rather than information sources might produce a single-room design with ‘team areas’ or stations for particular roles to interact—an intelligence or a logistics desk, for example.</p><p>The key issue for these users is visualising the state of the task; one user commented, “the environment doesn’t change, it’s the task that changes”. This is not entirely true of course—the changing element in the environment is however the avatars themselves, so that their identity and activity is what the environment really ought to communicate. However supporting the visualisation of maps, the key information source for military planning, would be a better use of 3D for these users: “Really good (virtual) 3D mapping would be excellent; especially, if you are able to work with and annotate the maps.”</p><p>The identification mechanism adopted of labels over avatars’ heads was not completely successful. Such legends may be hard to read—as can be seen in Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig1">1</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig3">3</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-004-0143-z#Fig6">6</a>—and at a sensible size take up too much space. Texturing avatar faces with those of the users themselves ought to be tried—not possible in this study because the identity of the individuals participating was known only a short time before the study took place. However, individualised faces along with further clothing cues might have been attempted. As with navigation, it is hard to think of a currently viable mechanism to allow a user to invoke complex expressive features in an avatar without imposing a high degree of effort. The positive response of the users to web cam data suggests that compositing a video head-and shoulders onto the avatar’s face is worth considering in spite of the technical difficulties, at least when voice interaction between users takes place.</p><p>User responses underlined the importance of voice interaction in collaboration, and the importance of multi-voice conferencing. In spite of the use of a LAN there were still problems with audio quality in the experiment, and this was confirmed by a number of earlier studies (Tang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1994" title="Tang JC, Isaacs EA, Rua M (1994) Supporting distributed groups with a Montage of lightweight interactions.

The voice facilities of GROOVE were criticised, and though NetMeeting was seen as better in quality, participants would have preferred to use the phone. Voice-over-IP is still less reliable and of a much lower quality than telephony. Attempts to integrate NetMeeting into REMOTE along with the other applications were not successful, so that it had in fact to be run in parallel outside the environment instead of being triggered when two avatars met. Even then, the restriction to one-to-one conversation was far too constricting.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec14"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec14-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec14">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec14-content"><p>Running studies such as this one and learning from the results seems fundamental to the development of CVEs into a successful and useful technology. Collaborative activity is a particularly difficult area to support with technology, and this is all the more so for tightly coupled tasks with a high degree of inter-dependence such as in military planning (Olson and Olson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Olson GM, Olson JS (2000) Distance matters.

A deep understanding of the user requirements and how these can be supported with the technology as it is now cannot be achieved without such experimental work. In this case, a desktop VE was poorly received, but as we have tried to indicate in this final section, this seems more a case of iterating the design concepts than abandoning the approach. There is still a need to assess more explicitly the impact of these technologies on task performance and conduct to determine whether they provide the ability to enable the task to be done more quickly and more efficiently.</p></div></div></section>

This sheet is intended as an ‘aide memoire’ to structure the main themes to be covered in the debriefs.</p><p>Five ‘open’ style interview questions are given. Questions with brief ‘Yes/No’ answers are to be avoided. These are not intended to be prescriptive. Priority should be given to asking about the issues and problems that were surfaced during the experimental condition.</p><p>Finally, a number of non-directive questioning and ‘prompt’ techniques were included as suggested ways to keep the debrief discussions flowing.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec28">Debrief Topics for exploration</h3><p>ALL CONDITIONS (1, 2 and 3)</p><p>Q1. Were there any particular issues, problems or successes that emerged during the last condition?

What did you particularly like/dislike/feel was missing during the condition?)</p><p>Q2.
