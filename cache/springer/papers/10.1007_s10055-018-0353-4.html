    <meta name="dc.description" content="Since the 1950s, 3-dimensional virtual environments (3DVEs) have been developed to simulate real-world experiences. These virtual worlds have evolved with realistic graphics and large numbers of users with whom to engage in virtual representations of real-life situations. This study investigated how students perceived the usefulness of Second Life (SL) as a tool for teaching research methods to a doctoral-level qualitative research class. Two classes of doctoral students were assigned to groups of three students and were charged with conducting an ethnographic study in a SL community. Students conducted observations and interviews of community members as a simulation of conducting ethnographic research in an unfamiliar culture. Data sources included an end-of-course survey, observation field notes, interview transcriptions, journals, discussion board posts, and video conferencing. Nineteen students agreed to have their data included for analysis. Results indicate that SL provided an innovative means for teaching important aspects of qualitative research, such as securing key informants, gatekeeping, observing and taking field notes, and interviewing, among others. Students experienced the affective aspects of conducting research as well, including how to handle rejection and frustration, the need for flexibility, interacting in a strange world, and how to handle awkward situations, sometimes with hilarious results. While the majority of students found SL to be an innovative way to learn research skills, a few experienced technical glitches, causing frustration that hindered their learning. Students created a list of tips for new users of SL to ease their transition into the virtual environment."/>

These virtual worlds have evolved with realistic graphics and large numbers of users with whom to engage in virtual representations of real-life situations. This study investigated how students perceived the usefulness of Second Life (SL) as a tool for teaching research methods to a doctoral-level qualitative research class. Two classes of doctoral students were assigned to groups of three students and were charged with conducting an ethnographic study in a SL community. Students conducted observations and interviews of community members as a simulation of conducting ethnographic research in an unfamiliar culture. Data sources included an end-of-course survey, observation field notes, interview transcriptions, journals, discussion board posts, and video conferencing. Nineteen students agreed to have their data included for analysis. Results indicate that SL provided an innovative means for teaching important aspects of qualitative research, such as securing key informants, gatekeeping, observing and taking field notes, and interviewing, among others. Students experienced the affective aspects of conducting research as well, including how to handle rejection and frustration, the need for flexibility, interacting in a strange world, and how to handle awkward situations, sometimes with hilarious results. While the majority of students found SL to be an innovative way to learn research skills, a few experienced technical glitches, causing frustration that hindered their learning. Students created a list of tips for new users of SL to ease their transition into the virtual environment.</p></div></div></section>

It is a scientific and investigative approach to learning about the social and cultural life of communities, institutions, and any other groups of people, which involves rigorous research methods and data collection procedures to emphasize the perspectives of the people existing in the research setting (LeCompte and Schensul <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="LeCompte M, Schensul J (1999) Designing and conducting ethnographic research.

An added challenge surfaces when teaching how to conduct ethnographic research occurs in a course delivered 100% online. Students might be situated in different geographic zones and with different work and life schedules, making it difficult to conduct group work, travel to a specific location, and dedicate sufficient time to interact with its individuals, as is the case of the participants in this study. Researchers and scholars are seeking new ways to engage and teach their students ethnographic practices, with the same rigorous approach and strategies employed in ethnographic investigations in the field, but without investing extensive amounts of money required to travel, live, and interact with a community.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Uses of virtual environments</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><p>3-Dimensional virtual environments (3DVEs), also referred to as 3-dimensional virtual worlds, were developed to simulate real-world experiences, beginning in the 1950s, when Morton Heilig created the Sensorama (Rheingold <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1991" title="Rheingold H (1991) Virtual reality.

One of the advantages Bainbridge shares is that SL gives the researcher inexpensive access to large numbers of potential subjects. Creativity is highlighted in the researchers’ ability to use graphic tools to create simulated laboratories in which to conduct research. Bainbridge discusses the potential of SL as an experimental tool that affords novice researchers the opportunity to replicate older studies in a simulated environment and to practice research skills. He further notes that such topics as addiction, behavioral norms, and phenomenological meaning may be studied; anthropological ethnography and sociological participant observation were two qualitative paradigms he mentioned as being particularly fruitful for learning research methods through SL.</p><p>Communication in SL is made possible through various media, such as text chats, instant messaging, e-mail, voice chat, and gesturing in real time, and it offers opportunities for immersion and interaction via realistic, animated graphical self-representations, called avatars, that users may customize to their specifications (Minocha and Roberts <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Minocha S, Roberts D (2008) Laying the groundwork for socialization and knowledge construction within 3D virtual worlds.

SL offers the benefits of video conferencing—which allows users to hear voice and observe body language—but does not use such extensive bandwidth, and, similar to other 3-D worlds, it offers the opportunity to interact in a “world-like space” (Minocha and Roberts <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Minocha S, Roberts D (2008) Laying the groundwork for socialization and knowledge construction within 3D virtual worlds.

These avatars might appear human, animal, robotic, or some combination. Accoutrements available include various aspects of appearance, such as hair, eye color, makeup, clothing, and skins, some of which are free and others may be bought with Lindens; SL employs the use of a virtual currency, known as the “Linden” dollar.</p><p>The numerous worlds—or SIMs—of SL offer a variety of settings for interacting with others; these worlds are created by users, as are other objects, including buildings, vehicles, clothes, and stores, for example. Avatars can move around by walking, running, flying, or teleporting, depending upon which button on the computer the user presses. Speech gestures are also available that add animation to avatars’ speech with arm/head movements (Boulos et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Boulos MNK, Hetherington L, Wheeler S (2007) Second life: an overview of the potential of 3-D virtual worlds in medical and health education.

These included the opportunity for interaction; visualization or contextualization, including preservation of important content; exposure to unique content and culture; role play, immersion in a 3-D world; simulation; community membership; and design and creation of objects (p. 421). Barriers were also presented by Warburton, including:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">

This socialization has resulted in the creation of various groups/communities of people who bond as community members, because they hold similar ideals or values related to the culture. It is for these reasons that the principal investigator had students explore SL to find a culture to study. Similar to the experience of Boellstorff (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtually human.

The research questions guiding this study were as follows:</p><p>What is the experience of doctoral students learning qualitative research through use of Second Life?</p><p>What challenges and benefits do these students experience in using SL to learn qualitative research?</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec5"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec5-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec5">Methodology</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec5-content"><p>During spring semester, 2015 and 2016, the first author taught qualitative research to 56 doctoral students enrolled at a university located in the Southern United States. The course began with several weeks of instruction on the methods of conducting qualitative research, specifically ethnographic methods, and how conducting ethnographic research in RL might differ from the research they were to conduct in SL. SL was used as a tool to enable them to carry out ethnographic research and experience many of the benefits and challenges associated with conducting fieldwork in the real world. Using SL in lieu of having students conduct a RL ethnographic study assisted students in learning ethnographic methods of conducting research within the limited time frame of the semester and alleviated the costs of travel and living expenses, as participation in SL is free. Students were assigned to groups of three, and they were charged with finding a community in SL to study. During online class discussions, students shared what location they had chosen to study; in the case of different groups choosing the same location, the students were aware of who their fellow students were, so there was no problem with students interviewing each other. Further, the students were novice members of the community and, hence, did not have the depth of information about the culture required of interviewees. During the semester-long course, each student had to conduct at least two observations in the community under study, and each had to find one person to interview to help students better understand the culture. This required that students spend time in the online culture to get to know participants to be able to establish rapport and be accepted in the community. To facilitate this process, they were given instructions through instructional videos and online discussions for the assignment at the end of the previous semester, which gave them the opportunity to engage with the online world, establish an avatar identity, and begin to immerse themselves in SL prior to the beginning of the semester in which the course was taught. Only a couple of the students were familiar with SL. Some of the locations they chose included the bar scene (several locations), a fairy world, a furry animal world, a transgender group, a worship group, a Star Wars group, among others.</p><p>Authors were confident that, considering Second Life contains thousands of different simulations (SIMs) that cater to different interests and activities, participants would have plenty of options to choose from for their observations, although this might not have prevented from them studying the same communities, or even engaging and studying each other, while using their avatars.</p><p>Participants were required to download the Second Life viewer, which is available for free in the SL Web site. During the first semester of the study, participants were not given any special instructions on how to navigate in the environment; however, the second time the course was taught, participants were required to attend a session in Second Life at the beginning of the course, where they were given instructions on how to navigate in the environment, how to find SIMs to study, how to change their appearance, and how to log conversations with other avatars. In addition, four short videos were produced with further instructions on how to utilize the environment and made available to the participants.</p><p>The study was approved by the university IRB, and all students completed CITI training. Students were informed about the study, when they were introduced to the research project prior to the onset of the semester. Data were collected from students at the end of the semester. Students were asked to complete a consent form, if they chose to have their work during the semester included in the study. They had all informants complete a consent form or give a recorded verbal consent, after reading the consent form, as well. Students were instructed to conduct individual interviews with their chosen participants; however, in one case, the participant chose to be interviewed in a bar with other people present, a request with which the student researcher agreed. Students were advised that, at any time they felt uncomfortable, they could transport to another location to remove their avatar from the situation. The 19 students who chose to participate were asked to complete a survey to share information about their experiences. The sources of data that were used for the analysis included the journal entries, reflections on observations and interviews, discussion posts, survey responses, and e-mails from the students who agreed to participate. To avoid any bias concerns they had, they were asked at the end of the semester whether they wished to participate, and those who agreed to participate sent their data sources to the second author. Data were de-identified and analyzed thematically by first reading through all data sources and then assigning labels to units of analysis to create a coding scheme that addressed all forms of data. Data were then further analyzed to determine properties and dimensions of codes assigned, and themes were identified for reporting findings, following the analytic processes described by Braun and Clarke (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Braun V, Clarke V (2006) Using thematic analysis in psychology.

A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to sort, filter, and analyze the data, resulting in the ability of aggregate data to find common themes.</p><p>As the principal investigator journeyed through her students’ experience with SL, she was privileged to share in some of their thinking through their journals, discussion posts, and assignments. After trying out SL in the spring 2015 course, the second author developed a tip sheet and a series of short instructional videos for students taking the course in spring 2016 to help them maneuver within SL better, and the PI warned them that they might encounter values that were not in keeping with their own (and, if so, they should extract themselves from such places by teleporting to another location, if they chose to do so). The warnings were intended to help them become accustomed to meeting new and sometimes weird people in SL, but, in some cases, it appears that the warnings instilled fear about conducting research in such a strange place as SL.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec6"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec6-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec6">Findings</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec6-content"><p>The themes identified from the data addressed the benefits and challenges of using SL as a tool for learning QRM.

Using SL gave them access to participants, saved time, and enabled them to be comfortable. Regarding access to participants, students indicated that, through SL, they were able to have contact with participants they might not have had otherwise. One student stated that she was able to meet participants in a location in SL that she would not have frequented in RL. Several students mentioned as a primary benefit the variety of interesting people in SL available to them to interview. Conducting an ethnographic study through SL enabled students to do their research in the comfort of their home, minimizing risks and providing a comfortable venue. As one student stated, “I could conduct my study according to my own time frame, at my convenience, in my pajamas, with a snack and a drink.” Several students mentioned as a primary benefit of using SL the fact that it was a time saver; for example, one student pointed out that he/she “could get a sense of an entire culture without incurring the expense of travel or missed time from work,” while another noted that “I don’t think it would be possible to do real-world ethnographic research in a one semester course otherwise.” Being able to access participants through the virtual environment, interview them, and have the interview transcribed through the chat log was also a time saver that several students mentioned. A further benefit of the chat log was that it allowed students to “slow down my thought processes” to reflect on what more he/she needed to know before asking the next question. Another benefit mentioned by students included that SL provided “an incredibly diverse, practically endless variety of subcultures to choose from.”</p><p>Another benefit was mentioned by one student who stated that the experience helped their small group to “gel” as a result of their solving problems together:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                  <p>When going to SL on our own, we were easily frustrated and overwhelmed by the learning curve (which is why we mostly moved as a “pack” for the first three weeks). Things that made us laugh as a group (or that could frustrate us, when we were alone or forgetting to not take ourselves so seriously (included) trying to get out of a ceiling; trying to sit on a chair, rather than under it; learning that clothing was not suitable and figuring out how to find suitable clothing in which to conduct an interview; learning how to reinstall hair accidentally lost when trying to sit; getting stuck walking backwards; trying to jump and communicate; getting lost and panicking (like we were little kids), because we could not relocate our communities or partners once we had teleported; trying to figure out how to interact and chat with [each other] and with participants; ending up in an adult only section and not knowing how to get out!</p>
                </div></blockquote><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8">Challenges</h3><p>Students experienced numerous challenges in their research. The most frequently mentioned challenge related to their own attitudes, which afforded us opportunities to discuss the potential for bias influencing data collection and analysis. For example, several students described their experience as being frustrating, stressful, or overwhelming, in part, because they were learning about SL participants’ RL problems or because they encountered profanity or lewd behavior in their search for a culture to study and for participants to interview. Others noted that they brought personal biases into the field, but they later realized they would have to have an open mind to understand others’ behavior. As one student stated:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>Personally, I was skeptical at first. I had the challenge of overcoming my own biases (that people were mysteriously wasting time and should get a ‘real life,’ but I gradually learned to understand the attraction and was also impressed with how self-monitoring many of the residents were). I also had the challenge of feeling paralyzed the first time someone approached me and tried to strike up a conversation. It took me a few weeks to get over this.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Another challenge they mentioned were the technical glitches that occurred with constant buffering and lagging. One student noted, “I also had technical difficulties, because SL could crash itself and/or my laptop every so often.” Another said, “I could not seem to always stay logged in to SL.” One student mentioned the buffering issues as an impediment to the interview process, when SL kicked him/her off during an interview, and he/she had to restart the interview process with a new participant. Another student indicated that he/she was not able to run SL on an older laptop and had to get special permission to use a work laptop.</p><p>Learning the basics of maneuvering within SL was also a challenge for many students. One student elaborated, “I knew nothing of SL before the beginning of this semester, and it was difficult to learn the basics of movement, gestures, dress, etc. within such a short time period.” Even simple tasks, such as selecting a name for one’s avatar, were difficult; one student mentioned attempted more than 20 names, before she found one not already taken. Another student added the issue of understanding how to access the chat log as a challenge. One student interviewed a participant who insisted that they use the speech function and really talk to each other using their real voices; this posed a problem for the student, who was unprepared for recording a spoken interview.</p><p>Locating a culture to study and finding participants willing to be interviewed was also mentioned frequently by students as a challenge. One student explained, “Interacting with others was already difficult, but to get someone to interview seemed very overwhelming initially.” Another noted that he/she felt like an outsider among the closely knit community members. Still another student added that “some participants just wanted to enjoy their time interacting with the others in SL, and some were suspicious of the interview process,” which made it difficult for them to find willing participants. Part of the challenge, they noted, was finding communities where people were gathered, so they did not waste “many, many hours roaming around, where I couldn’t find any action.”</p><p>Time was a factor for students in terms of “getting in” at the right time to access participants, when the community was active. Establishing rapport requires time spent in the community to create relationships with participants to have key informants and potential interviewees who are willing to share their time and stories with the researcher. It was also a challenge in terms of “managing real life relationships with those who didn’t understand that my work looked like a game and who did not understand why it was important and time consuming to spend time and/or develop relationships within virtual reality.” Time was also problematic for groups regarding their collaboration, particularly for one group that included a student from another country. Several groups contained student members from different time zones, so collaboration was made difficult by their various locations. Another challenge for students was the fact that, when conducting an interview via chat, other community members in close proximity were able to read the chat, making confidentiality impossible; in some instances, they joined in the interview, interjecting their input. Another concern, particularly when other community members were present, was whether participants were being honest with researchers or “pulling my leg.” One student mentioned that he/she felt that using the chat log to communicate encouraged participants to give short answers; he/she later learned that it is possible to speak, rather than use the chat function, which might have improved the depth of the responses. Other issues mentioned as challenging included learning how to code, which some students found difficult to understand, and writing up the findings.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">QRM learning enhanced through SL</h3><p>Every student who provided consent to participate in this study indicated that SL was an effective tool for learning QRM. They particularly found SL to be helpful to their learning interviewing skills related to “how to create interview questions, conduct an interview, how to code and analyze data.” They indicated that being in SL made it easy to access participants and arrange interviews. Having the chat logs alleviated much of the transcription work associated with interviewing. As one student put it, “Utilizing the chat feature, exclusively, enabled me to slow down my thought processes and focus on using the language of inquiry as well as reread conversations and reflect on them. This helped refine my conversational techniques over time.”</p><p>Observation skills were also enhanced through the use of SL. For example, one student noted that the experience alleviated some of the “awkwardness of observations,” while another suggested that SL “leant itself very well to thick description,” as the in-world graphics are so realistic. Several students mentioned that, by using SL to learn QRM, they were able to put into practice what they were learning in class. Some students felt that it was a challenging experience, “like being dropped in a foreign country where we barely spoke the language and being told” to focus on basic survival, rather than effectively conducting research. On the other hand, most students worked their way through these feelings of insecurity to learn about QRM. As one student concluded, “I was shocked at the end of the process how much I had truly learned.” Another student commented that “it was like an effective baptism into Qualitative Research.”</p><p>One student mentioned that doing research in SL helped him/her to recognize biases:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>Some of my colleagues attempted to speed through the work of being in SL. Although, like them, I was initially uncomfortable, I learned how to identify and remove my bias from the situation as much as possible in order to collect meaningful data. This is a truly important goal for qualitative researchers.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Another mentioned having learned that qualitative research “takes patience to develop the relationships that lead to honest conversations and valuable data.” One student’s comments summed up what many students expressed:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>While initially challenging, I definitely feel that SL was a great tool for learning how to do qualitative research. I’m a kinetic learner sometimes, so being able to actually put into practice everything that we learned throughout the course was a great way to actually test my skills with everything. Reflecting back, there is nothing that I would take away from the experience, because I definitely feel that this assignment has been instrumental in my understanding of conducting a qualitative study from start to finish.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Tips for future students</h3><p>Many of the tips the students shared for future students addressed the issue of establishing rapport. Several students mentioned having difficulty knowing where to go to find potential participants in a community they could study. One student shared this suggestion:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>Making friends in SL is similar to RL – if you go to certain places often enough, you see the same people, have conversations, and begin to develop friendships/make connections. Students expecting to show up and chat will be disappointed. My group had a difficult time selecting a culture to study, because we couldn’t get anyone to talk to us, and we couldn’t find people! It is important for students to learn how to find where people are hanging out (in the destination guide, it tells you how many are in a given place).</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>To become familiar to potential participants, one student advised that future students show they are invested in SL by customizing their avatar to meet the community’s cultural standards. Another student warned that “some of the avatars can be distracting when trying to complete the assignment. I saw a half woman, half horse and a cat in dress tails on the dance floor.” Spending time in the community one wishes to study was emphasized by my students. They were told to make it clear to potential participants that they are conducting research. One student advised future students that “many of those I spoke with feel marginalized somehow in daily life, and interacting with a researcher who is obviously just there to get information makes them feel further marginalized in many cases.” Similarly, a student reported that there is a general negative view of researchers in SL; this student suggested that future students engage respectfully with others in SL, putting aside their notions of “how weird it is” and endeavor to enjoy themselves. As he/she put it, “it takes a playful and open mind.” Another emphasized how important it is to spend time in SL, when he/she explained that, had he/she spent more time in SL getting to know the culture and role play and establishing relationships with potential participants, he/she would have been provided with much better information, as he/she could have engaged with someone with more experience of the culture than the participant he/she chose to interview.</p><p>Another issue related to time spent in SL was explained by one student:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>At first, I was skeptical about being required to use SL as a tool to gather data and write up our research. I started early to establish myself in SL and to learn to navigate around. I did google tutorials and frequently asked questions for SL. I engaged the help of my two sons …to help me learn to move, fly, and teleport! Once I could do that, I began to look around for communities that might be interesting for our group to talk with. I tried many places, most of which I had to request to join. Our group met online in SL a few times before we even began collecting information. We used it as a discussion platform to form plans for the project. After we began collecting data by observing and interviewing, the whole research process began to make sense. I began to realize that this was a great platform (as long as you can find a culture to work with) for qualitative research.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Several students stressed how important it was to take notes with each foray into SL to help them remember what they had experienced. They noted that it is important to note in their journals what they learned from the articles they read and to record the forums or other artifacts of the culture as they encountered them. Another suggestion they shared for future students is to be aware that the technology can have glitches, and some devices are not equipped to engage well with SL, resulting in their being kicked out or crashing. They indicated that, while being in SL made it easy to access participants and arrange interviews, future students need to be prepared to use alternative methods to record interviews, as some interviewees may not wish to be interviewed in the presence of other community members or may feel more comfortable using voice than chat.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Suggestions for improvement</h3><p>An important part of the data analysis was identifying some helpful suggestions from students about how the experience might be improved for future students. They stressed that, prior to beginning the SL experience, I should emphasize to students that conducting research in SL is similar to visiting Six Flags theme park.</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>It can be chaotic, but once you learn the ‘lay of the land’ it is less intimidating. The different realms or worlds of SL are like the different rides at Six Flags, some are … tame, while others are wild, and just as no one is forced to ride the Ninja at Six Flags, no one is forced to visit the Asphyxiation Point Red Light District in SL.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Another student suggested making more connections between SL and RL, so participating students have a better understanding of what to expect. A couple of the students noted that future students should be warned that they may encounter griefers (those who cause grief to others for no reason), inappropriate language, nudity, and promiscuity, and they should either ignore it or move on to a different location; they also should be warned not to explore SL in the presence of children, as “SL can be vulgar.”</p><p>Students seemed to have difficulty learning the basics of SL; as a result, they suggested that future students participate in a group class meeting in SL where they can learn the basics of movement, how to dress their avatar (and finding where to purchase or get free clothing), and find potential communities to study, possibly provided in workshop format by an experienced former student as guest speaker. One student even mentioned that the cost of customizing an avatar might be included as a required resource for the course, just as purchasing a textbook is. They also suggested that there be more opportunities to share what they were experiencing, such as a discussion board devoted to SL. One student mentioned that</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>in an ideal world, this would be two semesters – one for a thorough grounding in all of the theory and approaches and learning all the basics of SL and selecting your community, and then writing the paper in the second. Then, you could include a Lit Review that was longer in the paper and improve the quality of the final product. It was a lot to learn on several fronts in one short semester.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>A couple of students made suggestions about the examples provided throughout the semester, asking that they be shared “up front” and placed in one folder within the first module of the online course. One student indicated that he/she would have liked to have the option to conduct research within SL or in RL. Some of the problems mentioned were that “SL takes a lot of time, you get dropped by your computer, it is not as easy to relate to people, and it can be hard to find people online due to the time change.” This student also suggested that step-by-step instructions for coding and analysis be given.</p><p>One student suggested that more connection to School Improvement (the doctoral degree program they are in) be made, while another student suggested that the course professor should emphasize non-ethnographic approaches and various coding approaches, rather than focusing on ethnography and an inductive grounded theory approach to coding and analysis; it is assumed that this student meant that the course professor should relate additional approaches, such as discourse analysis or interpretative phenomenological analysis, though these were the topics of assigned readings in the course. To make coding easier, one student suggested that they be required to conduct more interviews, so they have more data to code individually before meshing their coding schemes with other group members.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Overall experience</h3><p>As noted earlier, bias was evident with some students at the beginning of the semester; for example, one said, “I have never been a huge fan of virtual games/activities and have chosen not to engage in them in the past. Even when they seemed so popular with others, they just weren’t interesting to me. So, with this research, I think that bias prevented me from engaging in SL as much or as often as I could have.” Despite the initial negative feelings some students had about SL as they began the process, by the end of the semester, their comments were more positive. As a student noted, “I thought that the SL world would be just a bunch of losers. I thought it would be people that were not capable of friendships.” Another said, “I guess it is the place where you can be the person you wanted to be. I can see why some people would like the site. It is kind of an escape from reality.” One student’s comment summed up what I heard from most students in this study, when she said:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>So, I have had some of the same experiences as some of you out there! I have been hit on (multiple times), yelled profanities at, for no reason, and seen things I cannot unsee between avatars! My experiences in SL were funny stories to tell at the office, but nothing that I would want to engage in after this project! After conducting my interview, I have a different outlook of SL as a whole. The person that I interviewed found [name of community in SL] an incredible source of support and friendship. She has a business in SL and had met her husband there years ago. She is hesitant to share these things with people for fear of judgment. She has had to uproot a lot, because she is a [military] wife and found others on SL that she felt respected by and at home with. The interview completely changed my perspective. Just like in our real life, there are people and areas to avoid, but there are really supportive people and communities in SL too.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>This comment on the discussion board was supported by numerous other students who added that they could see SL as serving a role as a type of support/therapy group, such as for those with disabilities or those with agoraphobia. It provides the opportunity for them to interact with others when and how they choose to, presenting to the world the avatar they create to represent themselves. Another added to this idea, saying that “what you cannot face in RL, you can face in SL.”</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec13"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec13-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec13">Discussion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Findings related to the literature</h3><p>Several findings of this study mirror those of Warburton (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Warburton S (2009) Second life in higher education: assessing the potential for and the barriers to deploying virtual worlds in learning and teaching.

For example, students explained that one of the benefits of participating in a research project in SL was that it gave them opportunities for interaction with potential study participants. Further, their SL experience facilitated their exposure to unique content and cultures. Warburton also mentioned role play in a 3-D world as a benefit of participating in SL; several students participated in role play in the cultures they studied. One group became members of a Star Wars role play community, while another group participated as furries (avatars that appear to be small, furry animals). Several students mentioned that their participation had enabled them to begin to feel like a real part of the SL community they were studying, a benefit Warburton mentioned as well. One student noted that a participant had taught her to design and create objects in the 3-D world, another benefit Warburton discussed. Another aspect of their participation in SL students mentioned as being a benefit was that they felt much as Boellstorff (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Boellstorff T (2008) Coming of age in second life: an anthropologist explores the virtually human.

Some of the ethical issues my students encountered were mentioned by Botterbusch and Talab (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Botterbusch HR, Talab RS (2009) Ethical issues in second life.

To further address the issue of teaching them the basics of maneuvering within SL, in future, both authors will hold several initial sessions in Wolfton (a virtual island in SL created by the second author for the university to use) to give instructions for some of the basic elements students mentioned above and solicit the help of a former student who is now well versed in using SL to explain what they may experience. As suggested by Jarmon et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Jarmon L, Traphagan T, Mayrath MC (2008) Understanding project-based learning in second life with the pedagogy, training and assessment trio.

As it was noted to them in response to one assignment:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>I’ve noted that some of you have jumped into this assignment with both feet and have really gotten the experience I wanted you to have as a result of having really immersed yourself in this culture. When I’ve read your observations and interviews (and field notes), I’ve seen that some of the concepts that are very difficult to relate through lecture have been experienced by you; for example, gaining entry into a culture (gatekeeping), feeling like a stranger in a strange land, establishing rapport, asking the right questions in interviews to get the responses that will help you answer your research questions, finding a key informant, the importance of hanging out and learning about the culture through observation (which includes chit chat and asking questions). You’ve also honed your observation (and descriptive) skills and your interview skills. You’ve also experienced the frustrations that researchers feel, when they engage in a strange culture. You’ve also seen how important it is to keep your mouth shut and listen, learning to ask those delving questions that get the interviewee to open up and tell you more. Some of you have felt like an outsider, felt confused, frustrated, insecure (some of your experiences have caused you to reflect on yourselves), and more. This is all part of the true ethnographic experience.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Through their complaints throughout both semesters, they also related feeling that the experience, on the whole, was enlightening, and SL does provide a venue through which they were able to experiment with various qualitative research methods and the associated aspects of conducting qualitative research. Most of them indicated that they enjoyed the course and felt that SL had been a helpful tool for learning about qualitative research. They found it to be “both interesting and entertaining,” “creative, yet challenging,” “a memorable way to learn qualitative research.” Other comments were that they felt “less apprehensive about the research aspect of the dissertation after this class.”</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec16"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec16-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec16">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec16-content"><p>SL provides an interesting, entertaining venue through which students can conduct research and practice their research skills. It contains hundreds of communities/worlds that address just about any conceivable focus, from vampires, to elves, to furries, to LGBT communities, to the bar scene, to support groups, to worship services. The authors acknowledge that although Second Life is providing students with authentic experiences, tools, and procedures for carrying out ethnographic research in a fairly secure environment, it night never be able to replace the real experience when conducting this type of research in a real community. However, we value the advantages that it offers for educational purposes, such as convenience and low cost for students, especially when enrolled in courses delivered in an online format.</p><p>Students, many of whom are unfamiliar with SL, benefit from having some preparatory work that includes learning the basics of customizing their avatar and maneuvering through SL. As students noted, it would be helpful to them to have the opportunity to meet as a class in SL to become accustomed to the virtual world as a potential research venue. With appropriate preparation, students may find that conducting research in SL offers them the time- and cost-saving benefits of doing research online, along with providing the opportunities for them to learn QRM in an interesting way.</p></div></div></section>
