    <meta name="dc.description" content="Age invaders (AI), is a novel interactive intergeneration social-physical game which allows the elderly to play harmoniously together with children in the physical space, while parents can participate in the game play in real time remotely in the virtual world through the internet. Traditional digital games are designed for the young where normally the player sits in front of a computer or game console. Unlike standard computer games, age invaders brings the game play to a physical platform, and requires and encourages physical body movements rather than constraining the user in front of a computer for many hours. Age invaders is an interactive social-physical family digital game designed specially for a harmonious game play between the elderly and young. Adjusting game properties automatically compensates for potential elderly disadvantages, for example slower reaction time and slow movement."/>

Present technology does not often allow the facilitation of family entertainment. Most children greatly enjoy playing computer games from childhood and most of them do not like to take part in more elderly style games such as chess games or fishing. Moreover, most of current computer and video games do not involve physical body movements and social interactions which are proven to be essential for the enjoyment of life (Bowlby et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1983" title="Bowlby J (1983) Attachment and loss, vol i: Attachment.

It is important to put in place a social and physical inter-generational family entertainment system that can connect family members in the home and away from the home.</p><p>Age invaders (AI) is a novel interactive intergeneration social-physical game that allows the elderly to play harmoniously together with children in physical space while parents can participate in the game play in real time through the internet. This game is based on the popular traditional Space Invader (Space Invader. <a href="http://www.spaceinvaders.de">http://www.spaceinvaders.de</a>) arcade game.</p><p>The concept of the age invaders game is outlined in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig1">1</a>, two children are playing with two grandparents in this interactive physical media space while two parents can join into the game via the internet as virtual players, thus increasing the inter-generational interaction.

                     <p>The game offers adaptable game parameters to suit the simultaneous gaming of elderly and young. Automatically adjusting game properties compensate for potential elderly disadvantages, for example slower reaction time and slow movement. For example, the laser beams launched by the elderly are faster than those of the children’s, and vice versa. This property is important to sustain the players’ interaction and interest in the game.</p><p>We remember that in pre-computer age, games were designed and played out in the physical world with the use of real world properties, such as physical objects, our sense of space, and spatial relations. Nowadays computer games focus the user’s attention mainly on the computer screen or 2D/3D virtual environment, therefore constraining physical interactions. However, there seems to be a growing interest in physical gaming and entertainment. Commercial arcade games have recently seen a growing trend of games that require human physical movement as part of interaction. For example, dancing games such as Dance Dance Revolution and ParaParaParadise by Konami are based on players dancing in time with a musical dance tune and moving graphical objects. However these systems still force the person to stand in more or less the same spot, and focus on a computer screen in front of them. Nevertheless, our underpinning philosophy is similar. One of the goals for age invaders is to bring physical gaming into computer entertainment. Thus, unlike standard computer games, AI requires and encourages physical body movements rather than constraining the user in front of the computer for many hours. It also incorporates puzzle solving games which encourage cognitive stimulating activities for the health benefits of the elderly and young. Recently the Brain Training games on Nintendo DS have gained huge popularity among the elderly Japanese (Fuyuno <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Fuyuno I (2007) Brain craze.

The elderly players believe that such games can sharpen their thinking and they enjoy playing the games very much. Moreover, hospitals in Japan are turning to Nintendo DS Brain Training as an aid in stimulating the minds of elderly patients (‘Brain Training’ Video Game Huge Hit Among Japanese Elderly. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,187337,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,187337,00.html</a>). Thus, we believe there is a growing need and trend for video games which promote physical activity and mental stimulation for youth and elderly people.</p><p>AI uses a floor display, which is an unconventional interface for mixed reality entertainment. The key advantage of floor display over head mount displays (HMD) or other wearable display is that it does not require the user to wear something bulky and perceive the world through the device. This is an important feature for elderly to participate in Augmented Reality games. The floor display is very intuitive and provides users with a direct connection to the virtual game world using their whole body as the interface.</p><p>Players can move around the game platform as they would for normal activities without having to adapt to a new display interface. In real time, as the players move and launch laser beams, it will appear that it is physically coming out of their bodies, which gives a real time link between the real world and the virtual world. This will immerse the players into the game and introduce high physicality (Price and Rogers <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Price S, Rogers Y (2004) Let’s get physical: the learning benefits of interacting in digitally augmented physical spaces.

In 1950, just 8% of the world population was aged 60 years or over. By 2005 that proportion had risen to 10% and it is expected to more than double over the next 45 years, reaching 22% in 2050 (World Population Prospects <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="World population prospects: the 2004 revision (2005) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Population Division" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#ref-CR25" id="ref-link-section-d62157e426">2005</a>).</p><p>The problem of increasing population of the elderly brings along many socio-economic issues. For example, the elderly require increased health care for both mental and physical problems. Many of these problems derive from social isolation and lack of activity. Findings from scientific research studies show that playing video games can lead to changes in an individual’s pleasure, arousal, dominance, and/or affiliative behavior (Christian <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1978" title="Christian HK (1978) Activity analysis of electronic game simulators.

Furthermore, elderly enjoy computer gaming experiences (Whitcomb <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Whitcomb GR (1990) Computer games for the elderly, ACM SIGCAS Comput Soc Arch 20(3):112–115" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d62157e441">1990</a>). Therefore it is a highly positive move to use digital new media to increase elderly happiness, through social interaction, physical activity, and entertainment.</p><p>Participation in an activity helps elderly to feel better and healthier, as they recognize their ability to move and create something, which is important to produce a sense of health (Matsuo et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Matsuo M, Nagasawa J, Yoshino A, Hiramatsu K, Kurashiki K (2003) Effects of activity participation of the elderly on quality of life.

According to a recent report, moderate, regular exercise may be just as helpful in combating serious depression in older people as antidepressant medication (Babyak et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Babyak M, Blumenthal J, Herman S, Khatri P, Doraiswany M, Moore K, Craighead W, Baldewicz T, Krishnan K (2000) Exercise treatment for major depression: maintenance of therapeutic benefit at 10 months.

Therefore, we believe that cognitive stimulating activities such as promoted in age invaders could possibly help in part of the prevention process and reserve cognitive impairment in many elderly, and also reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Singapore, as in many countries around the world, has a rapidly aging population and the trend shows that the family is a strong source of financial and emotional support to the elderly. According to Census data, the majority of those aged 65 years and above lived with their children and grandchildren (State of the Family in Singapore, <a href="http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/CommitteeontheFamily/Research/Executive+Summary.htm">http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/CommitteeontheFamily/Research/Executive+Summary.htm</a>). Furthermore, often a unique bond connects grandparent and grandchildren (Carson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Carson L (1996) The essential grandparent.

Grandparents can have significant impact on their grandchildren’s lives in many different ways. They can act as the family historian, mentor, playmate, nurturer, role model, confidante, advocate, advisor, and surrogate parent. The more grandparents and grandchildren are in contact with each other, the more the relationship grows and the more influence grandparents have (Kornhaber and Woodward <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1985" title="Kornhaber A, Woodward KL (1985) Grandparents/Grandchildren: The Vital Connection.

As children nowadays are more inclined to play computer games, it is necessary to create a new platform of interactive games so that the elderly and young can play harmoniously together in a physical space and in long run strengthen the intergenerational bond. The age invaders would fit perfectly into the Singapore family setting where most of the grandparents stay with their children and grandchildren. The customizable dimension of age invaders platform means that most households can afford to have one unit setup in their living room according to the size of their home.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">Prior research</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><p>Very few works have promoted computer entertainment for the elderly, even though it has been shown that elderly enjoy the computer gaming experience (Whitcomb <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Whitcomb GR (1990) Computer games for the elderly, ACM SIGCAS Comput Soc Arch 20(3):112–115" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d62157e484">1990</a>). Related and importantly, it has been shown that elderly are open to new technology experiences: in a study involving seniors at an apartment building, 49% of the seniors who took part expressed interest in learning about new and more challenging software and 26% were interested in computer programming (Hollander and Plummer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1986" title="Hollander EK, Plummer HR (1986) An innovative therapy and enrichment program for senior adults utilizing the personal computer.

Age invaders promotes new entertainment computer technology experiences for the elderly.</p><p>In a study to investigate the possibility that slow-down in performance of the elderly could be reversed through practice on videogames, Pac Man and Donkey Kong which require a measured response selection and have been regarded by elderly as challenging were chosen. The results showed that the weekly high scores on Pac Man nearly tripled over the seven-week period, and Donkey Kong improved almost fivefold for the group of elderly being surveyed (Clark et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1987" title="Clark JE, Lanphear AK, Riddick CC (1987) The effects of video game playing on the response selection of elderly adults.

Previous research in mixed reality gaming has been seen in Human Pacman (Cheok et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Cheok AD, Fong SW, Goh KH, Yang X, Liu W, Farbiz F, Li Y (2004) Human pacman: a mobile wideare entertainment system based on physical, social and ubiquitous computing.

While Human Pacman has high social and physical interactions, it has a disadvantage of requiring heavy equipments, sensors and HMDs which is not suitable for elderly people.</p><p>Many intergenerational interactive games developed are in the form of board games. Very little work is found on developing intergenerational computer games. However studies show that greater participation of the elderly and young in computer-related activity benefited both parties (Jaycox and Hicks <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1976" title="Jaycox K, Hicks B (1976) Elders, students, and computers.

Taken into consideration that difficulty of using a keyboard is one of the major problems of elderly using computers, bringing computer games into physical game space could be a positive move, as it will remove the traditional keyboard interface to the digital world.</p><p>Thus, by also incorporating inter-generational play, age invaders is a mixed reality game aimed to improve the welfare of the elderly using interactive media. We believe that age invaders will provide a framework for many inter-generational entertainment technologies in the future such as real time virtual-physical dancing game where the grandparents or parents will create the sequence of dance steps on the online virtual interface which will appear in real time on the physical game board where the children are dancing on.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec4"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec4-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec4">General methodologies for designing computer related games for elderly used in age invaders</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec4-content"><p>As mentioned in the previous section, AI has elderly people as the main targeted group of players. Increasingly modern societies are facing the problem of an ageing population; hence it is important to get this large proportion of population to be involved in the activities in digital entertainment. Computer entertainment, or more specifically computer games for elderly, is the focus of this paper. However the process of designing this type of computer game is complex, mainly because of the fact that older people are not as computer-literate as their younger counterparts, and even if they are, there is a higher possibility that they do not engage much in today’s computer related games, which are often mainly designed to stretch youngsters’ brain and finger muscles reflexes to the limit. Designing games for the elderly requires much more understanding of the players. For this complex scenario we followed the following steps of methodologies for designing computer related games for the elderly:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Level of understanding of computer technologies</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>It is essential to gauge how well the elderly understand modern-day computer technologies before stuffing them with highly sophisticated gadgets. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), computers, consoles, Bluetooth devices and other indirect interfaces such as keyboard/keypad, joystick and pointing devices may all seem user-unfriendly for elderly as far as gaming is concerned, mainly due to small and cluttered display interface. It is necessary to, during the process of design, to conceal the technologies that are involved in the system, and to make sure that they work seamlessly with the intended application without the knowledge of the users. Thus, when we designed the age invaders system, we hid the technology so that the players do not need to operate any keyboard, mouse, or similar indirect desktop manipulation device. Instead the users’ body (or foot) becomes the natural and simple interface for the interaction. By moving ones’ foot on the physical platform, one directly moves one’s avatar. The laser trigger is a direct and simple interface, by pressing a single button, a laser beam will trigger on the physical platform.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Awareness of popular computer/video games currently in the market</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>Technologies have facilitated the development of computer/video games that once were unimaginable to the older generation. Virtual reality games which require players to wear head-mounted-display, are one of the many examples. The contents of games have exploded due to the advent of digital technology. However due to personal or social preferences, many elderly are not ready, and even unaware of such games currently available in the market. It is necessary to find out what are the potential games suitable for the elderly. By conducting a survey we determined that simple action games such as the 1980s Space Invaders game and puzzle games are suitable for the elderly, and thus incorporated these concepts in our design.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Medium of game play</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>System designers have to decide how the game will be played, where the game will be played on and what medium or interface is best for such application, whether it is arcade, network computer games, physical games or others. This part of design process should take into account the ultimate aim of designing games for elderly, that is, do we want the elderly to get more physically involved, or do we confine the elderly players in front of machines? As argued above, we determine that physical and social interfaces are of advantage, and thus such interfaces become a major part of our design.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Preference of team work/collaborative/multi-player/competitive or individual game</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>This is an important consideration because it concerns the social and individual behavioral aspect of the elderly players. Probably through playing multiplayer games with other age groups such as the youngster, could enhance better understanding and communication, and playing competitive yet friendly, collaborative games could enhance social cohesiveness. Thus the intergenerational social play was a strong influence on our game design.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Level of opponents</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>The elderly might be hesitant to play computer related games with the concern that their younger opponents (or machine opponents for that matter) are too strong for them; it will be uninteresting if the game is one-sided. It is important to have both the elderly and youngsters players to be at the same level playing field. To compensate the difference in physical reactions and mental reflexes, game parameters such as speed and complexity have to be different for different group of players. The concept of “adjustable game parameters” will have to be incorporated in the game design. Another consideration is the duration of the game. If the game was physical and prolonged for long hours the elderly might find themselves handicapped due to their physical body conditions.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Usability</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>The games should be designed for ease of use for the elderly. For this, large visual interfaces, simple graphics, and light equipment (if the game require the players to carry equipment) should be taken into careful consideration. The technology should make it easier for elderly to play the game, not to burden them with hard-to-use interfaces.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>User studies</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>After the game has been developed and played, it is necessary to carry out a three-phase user studies, they are: qualitative observation, Q&amp;A, and interview, to better understand their feedback. These user studies were conducted and are reported in this paper.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                  <li>
                    <p>Repeat the steps for next design</p>
                  </li>
                </ul><p>After gathering the user studies, the abovementioned steps should be iterated for improved design of the games. Our design went through a multi-iterative process.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec5"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec5-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec5">Goals</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec5-content"><p>The main goals of age invaders for the elderly generally focus on four major areas: social, physical, cognitive and psychological. The social aspect emphasizes family and inter-generational social interaction, sharing and support. The physical aspect attends to the aging individual’s need for physical exercise and expression. The cognitive aspect stimulates the mental functioning and improves the elderly adult’s mental stimulation. The psychological aspect refers to promoting personal integration, to the expression of emotions, and feelings of self-worth and wellbeing in a family interaction context.</p><p>Parents in modern society often have a mobile and digital life style. They are often busy at work and go frequently on business trips; hence it is not always possible to physically interact with their family. It is important to put in place a social and physical intergenerational family entertainment system that can connect family members in the home and away from the home. Age invaders will be a good platform for them to interact in real time with their grandparents and children.</p><p>Age invaders is not aimed to replace traditional family interaction; instead it is aimed to further enhance the family interaction and bridge the physical distance between family members through real time remote internet interaction with the physical real world.</p><p>Specific goals of age invaders are listed in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Tab1">1</a>.

Unlike standard computer games, age invaders brings the game play to a physical platform, and requires and encourages physical body movements rather than constraining the user in front of computer for many hours. Age invaders is an interactive social-physical family digital game designed specially for a harmonious game play between the elderly and young. Adjusting game properties automatically compensates for potential elderly disadvantages, for example slower reaction time and slow movement.</p><p>Age invaders is based on the ever popular traditional Space Invader (Space Invader. <a href="http://www.spaceinvaders.de">http://www.spaceinvaders.de</a>) arcade game. Space Invaders was designed and programmed by Toshihiro Nishikado for Taito, Japan in 1978 and remains one of the most popular arcade games ever made (Classicgaming. History: Space invaders. <a href="http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/spaceinvaders/history.php">http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/spaceinvaders/history.php</a>). Space Invaders has inspired a form of street art, pioneered by the artist Invader (Invader. <a href="http://www.space-invaders.com">http://www.space-invaders.com</a>). Using ceramic tiles, Invader and other street artists cement together mosaic images of traditional Space Invader aliens, bonus spaceships, and variations on those themes, sometimes including characters from the Pac-Man series of video games. The mosaics, many being small yet others as large as murals, are cemented onto building walls, lamp post bases, and other structures. The form has spread throughout the world and can be found in many cities including Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles, etc. Similarly, age invaders has retained the cultural icon of space invaders and the old analog and pixelated look of the old Space Invaders game. We have decided to use large LED platform as the game’s interface to bring out the analog design of the early computer games. The 3D online virtual interface is a fusion of futuristic 3D space environment with pixelated game characters and large analog LED platform. Age invaders aims to bridge the young and old culture by bringing the cultural and artistic elements of Space Invaders into modern digital family entertainment. The modern real time mixed reality game concept is easily accepted by the young children. On the other side, the elderly who were once sharing the culture of the early computer games in the 70s and 80s will find the analog and pixelated concept of age invaders more relevant and appealing.</p><p>Age invaders also introduces performance as play element. It is a new kind of entertainment where the game player also doubles as a performer. The players have to follow a predefined pattern which will light up on the electronic game floor in a given time, or else the health level of the player will drop quickly. This is an electronic pattern which they will see on the floor. Again we balance the game play, by making the pattern to be followed automatically more difficult for younger players, and easier for older players. This dance like movements introduced by the floor patterns has a performance element which would attract the audience’s attention and amusement. Instead of passively watching others playing computer games, in our system the audience could enjoy an immersive physical experience by watching the performance offered by this interactive media.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec7"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec7-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec7">System description</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"><p>In this project we have developed a system for mixed reality family entertainment. The system features a large floor display platform which is synchronized with the 3D virtual online interface in real time, real time position tracking of players, real time remote internet gaming, and automatic adjustment of game parameters based on customizable game functions which define the relationships among game difficulty, response speed, and the age. The system’s inter-devices communication is completely wireless with wireless trigger, wireless body display and wireless RFID reader shoes for real time position tracking of players.</p><p>The concept of the age invaders game is shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig1">1</a>, two children are playing with two grandparents in this interactive physical media space while two parents can join into the game via the internet as virtual players, thus increasing the intergenerational interaction.</p><p>In order to make the difficulty of the game to strike a balance between the young and the elderly, age invaders innovatively imposes some challenges for the invaders (the young). The invader footprint is one of them. In the game, the invaders will have to follow the footprints and they will have to remain in the grids with footprints on it. This is an electronic pattern which they will see on the floor. As mentioned above, the dance like movements deliberately introduced by the floor patterns has a performance element. Each invader will have two footprints for them. In any time when they are not in the grid that has their footprint on it for a certain period, their health will be deducted. This period is determined by the invaders’ footprint speed of the game statistics which can be adjusted by the virtual players at any time. To be fair, invaders will be awarded with one bonus if he/she has correctly follows the footprint track for ten times. It turns out that the footprint makes the game more interesting and challenging to the young and easier for the elderly. The young players have to constantly search in all directions for the footprint patterns on the floor and at the same time trying to launch laser beam towards the opponents and to avoid the opponents’ laser beam. Furthermore the young players’ laser beams are significantly slower than their older counterpart. This has encouraged great team work between the elderly and young player as the older team player always alert the young player for approaching laser beams.</p><p>Age invaders system architecture is show in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig2">2</a>. The system was designed to track players’ positions in real time using an RFID reader embedded in the players’ shoes. A large electronic game board made from high resolution LED blocks is where the game will be played on. In real time as players move and launch laser beams using the Bluetooth trigger, laser beams will be shown moving out from the blocks on which they are standing.

                     <p>To start a game, the players have to launch the age invaders program in the server. There is a tutorial to introduce the use of the game components, for example the LED game board, Bluetooth body LED display and the Bluetooth Trigger. The players are asked to put on the wireless body display, wireless trigger and wireless RFID shoes. After that the tutorial will explain how the remote, online players could participate in this game and the functions in the virtual player interface as shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig6">6</a>. The tracking and identification of players using the RFID shoes will be illustrated to give the players a good picture of how their movements in the physical space are translated into the virtual space.</p><p>Next, the game rules will be explained to the players. There will be two teams, invaders and defenders in the game. Each team consists of one elderly and one young player to enhance the team work and relationship between the elderly and young. All the players will start off the game with five energy levels indicated in virtual online interface as five hearts next to the player’s name. The players will lose energy level when being hit by laser beams and when failed to follow the footprint for the “grandchildren” case. The “grandchildren” have to follow the automatically generated footprint patterns on the floor and at the same time concentrating on the game to avoid being hit by laser beams which makes the game more challenging for them. These dance like movements introduced by the floor patterns have a physical performance element which would attract the audience’s attention and amusement. The players will gain energy level by stepping on the bonus energy pill dropped by the online players and by stepping on the footprint correctly for ten times consecutively for the “grandchildren” case. The players can launch the laser beams using the Bluetooth Trigger. The players will gain score when his/her laser beam hits the opponent and when he steps on the correct footprint for the “grandchildren” case. The game will end when one of the team loses all the energy levels or when the time limit of 15 min is up. The team with the highest score wins the game.</p><p>The players who are familiar with the game can skip the tutorial and proceed to the game directly. To start the game the players have to key in their name and age into the server and the game parameters will be automatically balanced by our system to compensate for the potential elderly disadvantages. These game parameters are dynamic and are adjustable by the remote virtual internet players during the game play, in real time. At any point of time in the game, “parents’’ can log on to a 3D virtual game interface via internet and participate in the game in real time manner.</p><p>The large screen at the side of the physical game platform will broadcast the 3D virtual reality interface of the physical game in real time. The players and audience will witness the link between the physical world and the virtual world vividly before their eyes. The statistics of the game like the health level and scores will also be shown on the screen. The scores and health board is located at the top part of the display screen. From there, the virtual players and physical players will be able to view the health status of the players as well as the scores accumulated by both sides. The screenshot of the board is shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig3">3</a>.

                     <p>The speakers connected to the server will be playing upbeat background music and sound effects for every action in the game for example walking, shooting the laser, explosion, jumping, special items, etc. The players’ physical movements cause these virtual sounds.</p><p>As the player pulls the trigger, a laser beam image will be displayed on the game board and head towards the opponent. The speed of the laser beam depends on who launches it. If the “grandparent’’ launches the laser, its speed will be fast so that the “grandchild’’ has to react very fast. On the other hand, the “grandparent’’ will have more time to react to the much slower laser beam launched by the “grandchild’’.</p><p>The players can dodge the lasers by hopping over it (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig4">4</a>) or just simply step aside onto other part of the game board, again promoting physical activity. If she is hit, an explosion pattern will be shown on the body LED display (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig5">5</a>). The online players can view the game play in real time with the virtual 3D game interface, which links the real and virtual world.

                     <p>The “parents’’ viewing the physical game through the internet could interact strongly by choosing which player to help and dropping bonus items for this player. He can drag-and-drop “barriers’’ or “energy’’ to help the game board players. The “barriers’’ and “energy’’ will appear almost immediately on the game board. As shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Fig6">6</a>, if the player stands behind the barrier and the laser is coming his way, he will be safe. If he hops on the “energy’’, his health level will increase. This provides a seamless game interaction between the real world players and the “parents” in the virtual world.

The elderly group comprises of five university employees aged between 45 to 60, and the young group comprises of five students aged between 16 and 20.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Observational and qualitative user study</h3><p>In the first phase, an observational and qualitative user study was carried out. Five teams were randomly formed which comprises of one elderly and one young. The teams were introduced to the game and the different components of the game. Later they were briefed about the game rules and the goals of the game. The players were given the opportunity to try the different components of the games for example the functions of Bluetooth RFID shoe, wireless laser beam trigger, wireless body display. Each player then walked and jumped on the physical platform to familiarize with the game interface. The young players were briefed about the footprint; the square pattern footprint is for the invaders and the circle pattern footprint is for the defenders. It was noted that the players were able to understand and follow the footprint patterns after first or second trial. Each team then competed with every other team and performed the role of both invaders and defenders in separate games against the same team. A total of 20 games, each lasts for 15 min were played in this user study. The online player sits next to the physical platform where the players were playing. The system designers act as the online player during this user study. All the games play were video recorded for further observation.</p><p>In this study, most of the elderly players were slow in understanding the game at first. For the first few rounds of games, there are many times when they failed to recognize the laser beam was approaching. The young players had helped their elderly partner by warning them about the approaching laser beam. Most of the young players have no problem in understanding the game right away and they are able to perform the footprint dance steps while avoiding opponent’s laser beam. Great teamwork was more obvious as the games progressed, as the players know their partner better. Some of them felt frustrated when they pressed the wireless trigger and no laser beam was launched. This feature of the game was explained to the player during the first round briefing but some of them have forgotten. So the players were briefed again about this game rule. Each player can only have one laser beam launched in the game board. Unless the laser beam is exploded or went out of the game board, they are not allowed to launch another one. After the player has registered this point, they enjoyed the game better and had come up with many interesting strategies among which is to jump over the opponent laser beam and launched the laser beam when the opponent was defenseless.</p><p>It was also noted that some of the players were not aware when they have lost the game. They still stood on the game board wondering what had happened because as they move on the platform, the square pattern did not light up anymore. When a player is in a game, as she steps on a block, a square light patterned is shown on that block indicating that the system has registered the player’s position.</p><p>Occasionally the players shouted at the online player to increase the laser beam speed when they felt that it was too slow. When the online player placed a bonus item onto the physical game board, the players quickly step over to collect it and they were very excited because their energy level increased. Sometimes when the players ran out of energy, they would shout at the online player for help. Based on this observation, we have decided to add in voice over IP feature to the game to encourage more real world to virtual world participations and collaborations.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Questions and answers (Q&amp;A)</h3><p>During the second meeting which is the next day after the first session, the players are requested to fill up a Q&amp;A form which consists of 16 questions as shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0#Tab2">2</a>.

                        <p>This survey was conducted on first time players of age invaders one day after first session of game play. There were 10 subjects. The age distribution was 50% 45–60 years old and 50% 16–20 years old. Gender was 60% male and 40% female.</p><p>For question 1, “Did the game grab your attention and maintain your focus?”, 80% answered positively which shows that most of them were concentrating during the game.</p><p>For question 2, “Have you played any games similar to age invaders before?” is aimed to identify the player’s familiarity with the game. Only 20% answered “yes”, 50% answered “not really” and 30% answered “no”. This shows that the subjects were not experienced with this type of gaming. For question 3, “Do you think adjustable laser beam speed is a good feature of a balanced game play?” and question 4, “Do you think the variable footprint speed is a good feature of a balanced game play?”, 70% answered positively indicating the popularity of these features of the game. For question 5, “Do you think the dancing with the footprint while playing the game is challenging?”, only the young players should respond to the question. As expected, 80% answered positively. From the positive response to questions 2, 3, 4 and 5, many players have not played similar nature game before; however they like the variable parameters for a balanced game play and at the same time find the game challenging.</p><p>For question 6, “Are you able to play the game without spending too much time at the instructions?” only 20% responded negatively. The two players were identified to be from the elderly group. For question 7, “Do you find that you are better at the game as the game progresses?”, 40% responded “Yes, very much”, 30% responded “yes” and 30% responded “not really”. Hence, the majority of the players find themselves better at the game as the game progresses.</p><p>For question 8, “Do you feel a sense of control over the game interface and input devices?”, 30% responded “yes”, 60% responded “not really” and 10% responded “no”. Majority of the players feel that they don’t have a sense of control over the game interface and input devices. 30% who responded “yes” are from the elderly group. This may be due to the fact that the users are new to the physical platform interface and the laser beam triggers which the buttons were not so responsive. We realize the importance of responsive input devices for engaging gaming experience and will upgrade the buttons for future improvement.</p><p>For question 9, “Do you have a clear picture of your progress to the game goals at any point of time?”, 70% responded negatively. All the young players responded negatively because they did not have a sense of the remaining time to step on footprints. For future versions, we will include a big screen with the time bar to indicate the remaining time to step on the footprints and audio feedback to the players to warn them that time is running out.</p><p>For question 10, “Are you aware when you are being hit by laser beam?” 100% responded positively. As a player collided with a laser beam, the block where he stood will be blinking and at the same time his body LED panel will also blink.</p><p>For question 11, “Do you feel immersed during game play?” and question 12, “During gameplay are you less self-ware and less worried about everyday life or self?”, more than 50% responded positively. This shows that they were immersed into playing the game. However for question 13, “Do you feel emotionally involved in the game?” 90% responded negatively. We believe that this is because the players in the test case do not know each other before hand and are not related in anyway.</p><p>For question 14, “Do you feel the sense of teamwork with your partner to achieve the game goals?” 30% responded “yes, very much”, 50% responded “yes” and 20% responded “not really”. For question 15, “Collaborating with different age group partner to play the game is fun?” 60% responded positively. Most of the players find strong teamwork during the game play and they enjoy partnering player from different age group.</p><p>For question 16, “Do you feel the presence of the online player as if he/she is part of the game?”, 30% responded “yes, very much”, 40% responded “yes”, 20% responded “not really” and only 10% responded “no”. Majority of the players felt strong presence of the online player in the game and they feel that he is part of the game.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Interview</h3><p>After the Q&amp;A session, the ten users were invited to play the age invaders game. Now they were very familiar with the game and could play the game without much supervision from the project coordinators. While the rest are playing the game, one by one, the players were called for a short interview.</p><p>When the elderly players were asked how competent they are in computer/video games technology, many of them responded that they do not play the computer/video games and do not have much interest in such games as they prefer playing games physically with real people. They pointed out that if the game platform size could be expanded further, it would make the game more interesting as they can have more space to physically move around.</p><p>Overall the responds about the game were good and the elderly and young players were excited to play the games again. They like the simple LED display interface on the floor. They were also looking forward to play many different games on this game platform. The elderly players enjoyed the team pairing with the young and they are happy that their laser beam speed is faster than the young players.</p><p>Many young players highlighted that they do not have a sense of control over the game interface and input devices because the game parameters are controlled by the online players. When they feel that they could not catch up with the footprint speed, they do not have direct control to slow down the footprint speed parameter. This is good for collaboration between the online players and the physical players as the physical players would seek help from the online virtual players to adjust the game parameters, in this case the footprint speed.</p><p>One of the elderly players suggested that there should be some kind of vibration feedback to the player on top of wireless body LED blinking and sound alert when the player collide with the laser beam. This is because the player cannot really see the body LED panel unless he lowers his head but this would obstruct the game play. However he can clearly see the explosion pattern on other players body LED panel.</p><p>Another player suggested that the footprint remaining time should be displayed on the big screen at the side of the game platform which was currently showing the virtual online mode. The player was frustrated because he did not know how much time was left for him to step on the next footprint.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Lessons learnt</h3><p>Additional projector display should be put besides the game platform to show the players status. The display should be large with simple interface to immediately feedback to the user on what had happened. There should be a time bar showing the remaining time to step on a footprint before the player’s energy is decreased.</p><p>We have identified social interaction as a key to the enjoyment of this game. We have observed that the physical players have constantly interacting with the online players throughout the game. In the experimental setting, the online player was just sitting next to the game board where he was able to interact with the physical players through verbal communication. However in the real setting, the online player will be remote from the physical players. Hence voice over IP or video conference would be a valuable addition to the current system in order to facilitate real and virtual world interaction.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec13"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec13-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec13">Future implication</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"><p>Age invaders uses a floor display, which is an unconventional interface for mixed reality entertainment. The key advantage of floor display over HMD or other wearable display is that it doesn’t require the user to wear something bulky and perceive the world through the device and this is an important feature for elderly to participate in Augmented Reality games. The floor display is very intuitive and provides users with a direct connection to the virtual game world using their whole body as the interface. Large LED display platform is chosen over projection display to retain the analog feel of the Space Invaders game. At the same time the LED floor display is not affected by shadow of players moving on the platform, compared to possible camera tracking based systems.</p><p>Age invaders system supports reconfigurable games. Using the existing system infrastructure, many game software and applications can be developed without having to create new hardware; thus there are endless possibilities for real time mixed reality family entertainment games.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec14"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec14-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec14">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec14-content"><p>This paper has highlighted the general methodologies for designing computer games for the elderly. The steps involved are level of understanding of computer technologies, awareness of popular computer/video games currently in the market, medium of game play, preference of team work/collaborative/multi-player/competitive or individual game, level of opponents, usability, user studies, and re-iteration of all the steps above.</p><p>In the user studies, the players are generally happy and excited in playing age invaders. They like the simple LED floor display, adjustable game parameters, and most importantly the social and physical nature of the game. Some suggestions for future improvements include larger game platform, better laser beam button response, feedback on the remaining time of the footprint and more games and applications for the system.</p><p>The main goals of age invaders for the elderly generally focus on four major areas: social, physical, cognitive and psychological. The social aspect emphasizes family and inter-generational social interaction, sharing and support. The physical aspect attends to the aging individual’s need for physical exercise and expression. The cognitive aspect stimulates the mental functioning and improves the elderly adult’s mental stimulation. The psychological aspect refers to promoting personal integration, to the expression of emotions, and feelings of self-worth and wellbeing in a family interaction context.</p><p>Age invaders moved beyond traditional digital games boundary to fuse artistic elements with modern mixed reality family entertainment. It has retained the cultural icon of space invaders and the old analog and pixelated look of the popular Space Invaders game in the 70s. Age invaders aims to bridge the young and old culture by bringing the cultural and artistic elements of Space Invaders into modern digital family entertainment. The modern real time mixed reality game concept is easily accepted by the young children. On the other side, the elderly who were once sharing the culture of the early computer games in the 70s and 80s will find the analog and pixelated concept of age invaders more relevant and appealing.</p><p>Age invaders also introduces performance play element. It is a new kind of entertainment where the game player also doubles as a performer. It is hope that this project could encourage more future works in fusing art and digital games to fulfill the scientific objective of improving the welfare of the elderly and family.</p><p>Videos of the age invaders system may be found at <a href="http://ageinvaders.mixedrealitylab.org">http://ageinvaders.mixedrealitylab.org</a>
