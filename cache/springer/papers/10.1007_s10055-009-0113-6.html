    <meta name="dc.description" content="Virtual reality (VR) has been used both to simulate situations that are too dangerous to practice in real life and as a tool to help children learn. This study was conducted as part of a larger more comprehensive long-term research project which aims to combine the two techniques and demonstrate a novel application of the result, using immersive VR to help children learn about fire hazards and practice escape techniques. In the current study, a CAVE was used to immerse participants in a fire scene. To improve the children&#8217;s motivation for learning over prior VR fire-safety training methods, game-like interface interaction techniques were used and students were encouraged to explore the virtual world. Rather than being passive viewers, as in prior related studies, the children were given full control to navigate through the virtual environment and to interact with virtual objects using a game pad and a 6DOF wand. Students identified home fire hazards with a partner and then practiced escaping from a simulated fire in the virtual environment. To test for improved motivation, a user study was completed. Results indicate that students were more engaged by the new game-like learning environment and that they reported that they found the experience fun and intriguing. Their enhanced enthusiasm for what is relatively standard fire-safety information demonstrates the promise of using game-based virtual environments for vital but otherwise tedious fire-safety skills training for children."/>

This study was conducted as part of a larger more comprehensive long-term research project which aims to combine the two techniques and demonstrate a novel application of the result, using immersive VR to help children learn about fire hazards and practice escape techniques. In the current study, a CAVE was used to immerse participants in a fire scene. To improve the children’s motivation for learning over prior VR fire-safety training methods, game-like interface interaction techniques were used and students were encouraged to explore the virtual world. Rather than being passive viewers, as in prior related studies, the children were given full control to navigate through the virtual environment and to interact with virtual objects using a game pad and a 6DOF wand. Students identified home fire hazards with a partner and then practiced escaping from a simulated fire in the virtual environment. To test for improved motivation, a user study was completed. Results indicate that students were more engaged by the new game-like learning environment and that they reported that they found the experience fun and intriguing. Their enhanced enthusiasm for what is relatively standard fire-safety information demonstrates the promise of using game-based virtual environments for vital but otherwise tedious fire-safety skills training for children.</p></div></div></section>

Virtual reality (VR) is one new and rapidly growing capability used for computer simulations. As equipment capabilities have grown, the applied uses of such technologies for education and training have become broader. In particular, VR allows full submersion into a virtual environment. As a result, VR can be used in training situations where it would be too dangerous or logistically impossible to have users participate in an actual event (Stansfield et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Stansfield S, Shawver D, Rogers D, Hightower R (2005) Mission visualization for planning and training. IEEE computer graphics and applications, pp 12–14" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR18" id="ref-link-section-d92247e313">2005</a>).</p><p>VR training reduces risk and improves logistics by creating virtual environments in which trainees can practice realistic simulated hazard situations or scenarios. Users typically wear head mounted displays (HMDs) and use 6DOF wands for navigation and interaction. Instructors can initiate any of a series of emergencies, from separate applications on desktop computers. Students are usually graded, and they lose points whenever they initiate incorrect actions that would lead to injuries in a real world environment.</p><p>For example, Kizil and Joy (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Kizil MS, Joy J (2001) What can virtual reality do for safety? St University of Queensland, Lucia, QLD" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR6" id="ref-link-section-d92247e321">2001</a>) developed a system to help prepare miners for dangerous situations that could not be addressed through traditional training methods. Haller et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Haller M, Kurka G, Volkert J, Wagner R (1999) omVR—a safety training system for a virtual refinery. In: Proceedings of ISMCR 99. Topical workshop on virtual reality and advanced human robot systems, Tokyo, pp 291–198" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d92247e324">1999</a>) developed a similar system to train refinery workers. VR has been used for training both emergency first responders and their commanders. In Li et al.’s study (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Li L, Zhang M, Xu F, Liu S (2005) ERT-VR: an immersive virtual reality system for emergency rescue. In: Virtual reality, pp 194–197" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR7" id="ref-link-section-d92247e327">2005</a>), as many as six first responders could participate in an emergency scenario while wearing HMDs. Trainees made decisions based on instructions given by their commanders.</p><p>VR has also been used in firefighter training systems. Navy firefighters traditionally train on retired battleships. Instructors create various types of fires, and the trainees are asked to respond to the situations. However, using VR, trainees can perform missions in virtual, rather than actual, fire environments. Researchers found that trainees demonstrate similar levels of learning, whether they train on an actual ship or in a virtual environment. However, virtual environments offer significantly less risk to the trainees (Tate et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Tate DL, Silbert L, King T (1997) Virtual environments for shipboard firefighting training. In: Proceedings of the IEEE 1997 virtual reality international annual symposium. IEEE Computer Society Press, Buquerque, NM, pp 61–68" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR20" id="ref-link-section-d92247e333">1997</a>).</p><p>The studies cited showed that VR systems can be effectively used to isolate trainees from dangerous risks during hazard skills training. Moreover, Sulbaran and Baker (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Sulbaran T, Baker NC (2000) Enhancing engineering education through distributed virtual reality. In: ASEE/IEEE frontiers in education conference. Kansas City, MO, pp 3–18" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR19" id="ref-link-section-d92247e340">2000</a>) also showed that learners usually enjoy VR training more than other traditional training methods and that they retain knowledge gained from VR training longer than that gained using other methods. As a result, VR hazard-skills training has the potential to reduce risk, increase acceptance, and improve effectiveness over prior training methods.</p><p>Recent related research has also focused on developing more advanced technology for realistically modeling fires in VR environments, for example, Sherman et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Sherman WR, Penick MA, Su S, Brown T, Harris FC (2007) VR fire: an immersive visualization experience for wildfire spread analysis. In: IEEE virtual reality conference. Charlotte, NC, pp 243–246" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d92247e346">2007</a>) developed a simulation application to graphically illustrate the spread of wild fires. However, they only focused on technical aspects of software and hardware development. They did not create or test any fire-safety training applications.</p><p>VR has also been used to teach children about abstract or difficult concepts. For example, Ohlsson et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Ohlsson S, Moher T, Johnson A (2000) Deep learning in virtual reality: how to teach children that the Earth is round. In: 22nd annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Philadelphia, PA, pp 364–368" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR10" id="ref-link-section-d92247e352">2000</a>) developed a VR system which they used to communicate a key learning concept: that the Earth is round. According to the researchers, the concept can be hard for children to grasp because all of their day-to-day experience with the Earth apparently conflicts with this fact. In their system, children worked in teams of two to collect objects on a virtual asteroid. One child, within a CAVE, acted as an astronaut on the face of the asteroid. The second child, from an ImmersaDesk™, acted as a mission controller. The mission controller helped their teammate navigate on the virtual asteroid. The study showed that, after training, children could translate their experiences from the virtual asteroid to the way they thought about the Earth.</p><p>In two studies, Roussou et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Roussou M (2004) Learning by doing and learning through play: an exploration of interactivity in virtual environments.

Fractions with bigger numbers in the denominator are actually smaller than those with smaller denominators. However, the fact seems counterintuitive to young children. To address the need, the researchers used a VR playground paradigm in which they asked children to help several animated characters locate and place playground equipment based upon the fraction of the total playground area they occupied. While there was no evidence that any concrete learning took place, the researchers concluded that students were given a new context in which to think about fractions.</p><p>In another example, Kaufman et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Kaufmann H, Schmalstieg D, Wagner M (2000) Construct3D: a virtual reality application for mathematics and geometry education.

In a pilot study, they then used the application to help students grasp difficult concepts in geometry. In their study, students wore a HMD and viewed a virtual world. They used a pen interface and buttons which were drawn on actual notebooks which the users held in their hands. After the training, all of the users in the pilot study expressed positive feelings about the VR interface and about their confidence with the geometrical concepts presented.</p><p>An example of a VR “sandbox” system is the NICE project (Roussou et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Roussou M, Johnson AE, Moher TG, Leigh J, Vasilakis CA, Barnes CR (1999) Learning and building together in an immersive virtual world.

Children could plant seeds, provide sunshine and water for their plants, and watch the plants grow. The system allowed children to experiment with different kinds of plants and with giving the plants varying levels of water and sunshine. Researchers found that the open-ended style of play which they used engaged children and encouraged them to create narratives to go along with their experience.</p><p>From the cited references, VR can be used to effectively communicate key concepts to children in effective “sandbox” learning environments. Other studies show that games, in general, can be used as an effective means for engaging children in material that they might otherwise consider to be difficult or boring to learn. For example, in prior studies, researchers have used games to teach children how to protect themselves in the event of a fire and help children learn to cross a street more safely (Padgett et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Padgett LS, Strickland D, Coles CD (2006) Case study: using a virtual reality computer game to teach fire safety skills to children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome.

However, none of the studies focused on developing game-based immersive VR-based fire-safety training systems. Some prior studies focused on communicating key learning concepts, while others focused on creating general “sandboxes” that allowed children to freely explore pre-defined learning environments.</p><p>The current study combined findings from several prior research areas and, based upon the findings, designed and evaluated an interactive game-based VR fire-safety training system for teaching elementary school children about fire safety. The current study was completed as part of a larger more comprehensive long-term research project which aims to use immersive VR to provide effective high-risk fire-safety training to children. In particular, the project aims to (1) help children learn about fire hazards and (2) practice escape techniques by immersing them in virtual fire hazard and fire emergency situations. The two topics were identified, by firefighters who are participating in the project, as the two most critical aspects of fire-safety training for children. The long-term project was motivated by statistics which show that young children are one of the most at-risk groups in fire hazard situations.</p><p>In an initial study (Ericson and Smith <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Ericson E, Smith S (2008) Using immersive virtual environments for realistic life-size fire prevention and safety training for children.

The virtual environment was designed as an immersive teacher–learner environment. Firefighters who were participating in the study served as instructors. One firefighter led a group of children through a virtual house that had specific fire hazards which the firefighter helped the children to identify. They also discussed how to eliminate the hazards. The firefighter also triggered a simulated fire in the house and then taught students how to escape from the fire.</p><p>Although results of training in the virtual environment were positive, many of the children were frustrated by the lack of interaction they had with the environment and some lost interest or motivation during parts of the training session. As a result, additional research was conducted concerning how to design more-effective virtual-training environments for children.</p><p>The goal of the current study was to increase learner motivation, over prior methods used in the overall study, while maintaining or enhancing learning about fire hazards and fire-escape techniques. The method used to achieve the current study goal was to use game-based VR techniques to make fire safety fun and engaging to learn, while actually helping children remember the steps they need to take to save themselves and others if they ever find themselves in a real fire emergency.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. First, results from an initial study of a first version of the system are presented and ways that were identified to address initial study issues are discussed. Then, the design of the second, more advanced game-based system is described. A discussion of the technical issues encountered during design of the second system, design of a user study for the second system, and results of the user study are given. Finally, a description of proposed future work is presented.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Initial study</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><p>In collaboration with the City of Ames, Iowa, Fire Department, the researchers initially developed a CAVE-based VR system for training children how to respond in fire emergencies. The system was designed such that, in which firefighters could lead children through realistic simulated fire situations. The firefighters provided guidance and instruction during the fire emergency simulations.</p><p>During initial system design, the researchers and firefighters decided that the most important information for children to gain from the proposed VR learning environment was how quickly fire spreads and that crawling low can help people escape from a burning building.</p><p>As a result, a virtual house was built, which contained several fire hazards and means for simulating a fire in the house. During the simulation, children followed an adult guide and a firefighter, as they walked through the VR house. The adult guide ran the simulation using a handheld 6 DOF wand and the guide led both the firefighter and the children along a prescribed path through the virtual house. The firefighter described fire hazards, provided information and motivation, and helped the children stay on task. At the end of the simulation, a simulated fire was started and the fire spread quickly through the house. The firefighter showed children how to crawl out of the burning house, to a safe meeting-place outside the house.</p><p>Initial study results showed that, while children learned intended concepts well and that they enjoyed the new technology more than prior fire-safety training methods, such as books, lectures, or videos, in general, they were also frustrated that they could not interact with the virtual environment directly. Many of the children said that they wanted to be able to actively explore the virtual house. A study by Roussou (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Roussou M (2004) Learning by doing and learning through play: an exploration of interactivity in virtual environments.

In the new system, several improvements were made to the user interface. In particular, ambient sounds and a novel interaction technique, which engaged users in a more active way, were both added.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">Game-based system design</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><p>In the current study, several special concerns were addressed during design of the more advanced system. In particular, the investigators aimed to develop a system that would both entertain children and, at the same time, provide them with information about the important underlying topic: fire safety. From the original initial study, the investigators realized that it was important for the system to be fun and accessible to young children, and, yet, not trivialize the message. As a result, the investigators chose to use a video game paradigm, while maintaining the original VR environment, fire hazards, and fire simulation scenario.</p><p>Video games are now prevalent among children (Mungai et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Mungai D, Jones D, Wong L (2002) Games to teach by.

At the same time, video games have also been shown to be an excellent tool for learning. The promise of games for learning lies in the facts that they are fun, they provide immediate feedback, and they allow users to experiment in a realistic environment without real-world consequences.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Basic system components</h3><p>Three primary open-source software libraries were used to create the VR fire-safety training environment: VR Juggler (<a href="http://www.vrjuggler.org/">http://www.vrjuggler.org/</a>), OpenSceneGraph (<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.com/index.php">http://www.openscenegraph.com/index.php</a>), and Open Physics Abstraction Layer (OPAL) (<a href="http://ox.slug.louisville.edu/~o0lozi01/opal_wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://ox.slug.louisville.edu/~o0lozi01/opal_wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>). Using the three libraries to develop the necessary software program allowed the research effort to focus on the educational content and the methods used to enhance interaction, rather than the low-level technical aspects of building the system.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec5">Realistic smoke</h4><p>The City of Ames Fire Department provided consultation during design and development of the system. City of Ames firefighters felt that, to carry the weight and impact needed for realistic fire-safety training, it was crucial that the system effectively mimic a real fire-situation.</p><p>The firefighters indicated that there were several important aspects of their requirement. First, from the very beginning of the fire, smoke had to be generated in a realistic way. Second, the smoke needed to continue to fill the room in layers from the ceiling, as it does in a real fire. In addition, the whole process needed to happen very quickly, since smoke can often fill an entire room in a matter of seconds (Pehrson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Pehrson R (2004) Fire behavior. In: Cote AE (ed) Fundamentals of fire protection. NFPA, Quincy, MA, pp 101–133" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR12" id="ref-link-section-d92247e476">2004</a>). Finally, the smoke had to be dense enough to obstruct the view of anyone who was standing in its midst, so that the participants were forced to crawl if they wanted to see where they were going. To handle the requirement, particle systems were used to simulate smoke in the virtual environment. As a result, the open-source Particle Systems API was used to create smoke for the system (<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~davemc/Particle">www.cs.unc.edu/~davemc/Particle</a>). The Particle Systems API is thread safe, and it features an API which is similar to that of OpenGL (McAllister <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="McAllister DK (2000) The Design of an API for Particle Systems.

To make the particles look like puffs of smoke, a function was added to the particle handler class to create each point in a given particle system as an OpenGL quad. A smoke-texture map was mapped to each quad and, as a result, a cloud of smoke could be formed.

The evacuation was the most important part of the simulated experience, since it represented the actual physical-evacuation practice that users got during the training exercise.

Fire Technol 29(3):268–280" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR13" id="ref-link-section-d92247e546">1993</a>) showed that physically acting out a procedure often makes it easier to remember, therefore, the investigators felt that the “game” should require users to practice an actual physical escape, by crawling from the fire scene. The most difficult part of trying to achieve the goal, in the context of an interactive game, was that, if done correctly, escaping from the fire had to take place in less than a minute. To maintain realism and training impact, the time limitation did not lend itself well to an interactive VR game experience with any sort of entertainment value. Therefore, the investigators added a separate task to the VR game, a modified version of the original search for fire hazards.</p><p>Fire department personnel stress fire-hazard training with children because fire-hazard training generally helps keep them away from dangerous items which may hurt them, such as candles, and help prevent a fire before it starts. For example, both the National Fire Prevention Agency (NFPA) and the United States Firefighters Association (USFA) maintain versions of a home-hazard search on their websites for children. In this project, the hazard-search game was developed from a list of common home-fire hazards provided by the City of Ames Fire Department. The following sections describe details of the game development.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec7">Navigation</h4><p>One of the primary complaints from participants, during the initial study, was that they wanted to explore the virtual house on their own, rather than being passive observers in the VR environment. Thus, in the second version of the system, a gamepad was used for navigation. The gamepad was an intuitive choice for navigation because gamepads are a standard input method for video games.</p><p>In the new system design, the right analog stick of the gamepad was used to rotate the players’ view and the left analog stick was used to move forward, backward, side to side, or in any combination of the given directions. Forward was defined by the direction the player was facing when they moved the left analog stick. The approach allowed users to face any wall of the immersive environment without needing to adjust the way they were using the gamepad.</p><p>Prior related research with games designed for education showed that intended users often expect a great deal from applications that are called “games”, and that they are often disappointed by the actual application (Elliott et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Elliott J, Adams L, Bruckman A (2002) No magic bullet: 3D video games in education. In: Proceedings of international conference of the learning sciences 2002. Seattle, WA" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d92247e562">2002</a>). As a result, the game-based version of the fire-safety application was designed to be as interactive as possible. The application allowed users to dynamically navigate through the environment, which required some form of collision detection that would prevent users from passing through objects in the virtual environment.</p><p>To address the need, OPAL was integrated into the visual simulation to create physical representations of all of the important objects in the virtual environment. In the active virtual environment, the user was represented by an invisible sphere, subject to the effects of gravity, and their movements were powered by an OPAL motor.</p><p>The terrain of the fire-safety environment was composed of a single model which included the ground, the house, and most of the furniture. As a result, the terrain, which was very complicated, could not be represented by a full object model.</p><p>For complex environments, OPAL users typically define mesh objects, rather than full object models. In OPAL, mesh objects are defined by an array of vertices and a second array that maps vertices to mesh triangles. Mesh objects with more vertices are more complicated; therefore they still require more computational resources to compute collisions for each display frame. As a result, overall, simulation objects were simplified as much as possible. For example, users were modeled as simple spheres.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec8">Interface</h4><p>To create a fun way to indicate hazards in the virtual environment a user interface was developed using a 6DOF wand. In the final design, users pointed the wand at an item they wished to remove from the house. The wand included a tracker that reported its orientation in the CAVE, and the orientation information was passed to a physics simulation which fired a ray in the direction the wand was pointing. The “laser” technique is very popular for object selection in 3D VR environments (Vanacken et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Vanacken L, Grossman T, Coninix K (2007) Exploring the effects of environment density and target visability on object selection in 3D virtual environments.

                           <p>Another theme the investigators saw from the results of the initial study was that many children were nervous about entering the virtual environment. Many asked if they would be able to bring a friend with them, with this in mind, the interface was designed to accommodate, and in fact required, two participants. Previous related studies have also found that, if two children use an application together, it is important that each has an important role to play, so that they are forced to collaborate (Ohlsson et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Ohlsson S, Moher T, Johnson A (2000) Deep learning in virtual reality: how to teach children that the Earth is round. In: 22nd annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Philadelphia, PA, pp 364–368" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#ref-CR10" id="ref-link-section-d92247e611">2000</a>).</p><p>As a result, the new fire-safety application was designed so that one child played the role of a Navigator, and the other child played the role of a Hazard Zapper. As a team, they were responsible for removing all of the hazard models in the house. To accomplish the task, the children needed to communicate with each other to both find and effectively eliminate all of the fire hazards. In addition, they were never alone in the virtual environment, which reduced their anxiety about the experience. However, working together in the house, without adults, helped train the children to handle the most-dangerous real fire situation, which takes place when adults are not present.</p><p>A heads up display (HUD) was added to the application to provide users with information because, with the new system, a firefighter was no longer with them in the environment. The HUD displayed instructions and information on the walls of the CAVE, so that the information was accessible to the users, no matter which direction they were facing.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec9">Hazard search</h4><p>Hazard removal presented a unique design challenge with respect to information sharing. Each hazard had to be represented by a visual model, which was removed when the hazard was discovered by the users. Actual hazard removal was not complicated, since most scene graphs provide functionality for switching a node on and off. However, in the new system, each hazard needed to be physically represented, so the user could not pass through the hazard until it had been removed from the environment. Therefore, both the visual simulation and the physical simulation needed to maintain a synchronized list of hazards and update the list as hazards were removed.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec10">Fire evacuation</h4><p>Cooking fires in kitchens are the most common cause of residential fires (United States Fire Administration <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="United States Fire Administration (2002) Protecting your family from fire.

As a result, a smoking pan was added to the house model, as one of the fire hazards. When time expired for the hazards search portion of the simulation, the children were instructed to find the kitchen. When they arrived at the kitchen, a kitchen fire began at the stove and spread out through the room. To create the effect, several particle systems were used in tandem. First, a small system that released puffs of smoke at large intervals was used to show that food left on the stove was burning. Then a larger, faster moving plume of smoke was used to show that a fire had started. Once the smoke reached the ceiling of the room a layer of animated smoke began to roll across the ceiling away from the source of the fire. After the first layer of smoke started, a fire alarm began to sound. One second later, another layer of smoke started, and the process continued until the final layer began.</p><p>When the lowest layer of smoke was approximately 3 feet from the ground, the CAVE switched into view-dependent mode. In view-dependent mode, if the users stood up, their viewpoint rose above the smoke ceiling and they saw nothing but dark heavy smoke. However, if the users crawled close to the floor, they could see their surroundings and find a way to escape, as shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6#Fig4">4</a>.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0113-6/MediaObjects/10055_2009_113_Fig4_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-4-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0113-6/MediaObjects/10055_2009_113_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="figure4" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"><p>Fire evacuation</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0113-6/figures/4" data-track-dest="link:Figure4 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                           <p>Following their escape from the kitchen and house the children were instructed to go to a pre-defined meeting place. Having a meeting place was one of the most important safety tips offered by fire fighters. Instructing users to find a pre-defined meeting place encouraged them to think about where a good meeting-place was outside their own home, and the layered smoke reinforced the concept that it is vitally important to crawl close to the floor in a real fire situation.

The training course included elements that Fire Department personnel felt were important in a useful fire-safety training course for children.</p><p>In particular, after the initial study, participating Fire Department personnel felt that the VR training environment should be used in addition to either video or personal contact training with firefighters. As a result, the new course combined both video and VR environment training. The new VR training system aimed to enhance or reinforce prior training methods, rather than to replace them. While, at the same time, the VR training system aimed to improve user satisfaction with VR fire-safety training and to improve overall user motivation during the fire-safety training program.</p><p>The simulation was run in a four-sided CAVE. The resolution of the projectors used was 1,280 × 1.024 pixels, and the refresh rate of the projectors was 96 Hz. The screen dimensions were 12′ × 9′ for the front, left, and right screens, and 12′ × 12′ for the floor screen. The frame rate of the virtual environment is application dependent.

                        </h3><p>Children played the VR game in teams of two. Participants were first given a tour of the VR system, so that they were somewhat familiar with the technology being used. The tour also provided an opportunity for discussion about how the game worked and for explaining the user interface that would be used during the training session. After the participants saw the VR equipment, they were taken to a classroom and a fire-safety pre-quiz was administered, to gage the participants’ baseline levels of fire-safety knowledge. Next, a video was presented, which showed a firefighter giving a fire-safety presentation. The presentation was designed to give the children a framework for thinking about the VR fire-safety application. After watching the video, a short presentation was given, which described, in detail, the user interface of the game system and explained the objectives of the game.</p><p>Next, the control group, which consisted of 10 children, took a post-quiz prior to using the VR application, while the experimental group, which consisted of 12 children, used the VR application first and then took the post-quiz.

The result was expected because the VR training system was used to reinforce the fire-safety material covered by firefighters during the video portion of the training program.</p><p>In addition, the quiz was designed to be short and simple so that children between ages 8 and 11 could easily complete it. As a result, some participants who scored very well on the pre-test did not have much room for improvement on the post-test. The limited range of the instrument may have affected the results.</p><p>However, qualitative study results show that the game-based VR training system did improve the children’s satisfaction with VR fire-safety training and their overall motivation for fire-safety training.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Zapping complications</h3><p>Noise associated with the tracker hardware made it sometimes difficult to aim at fire hazards in the environment, especially when pointing at objects that were far away from the users or not at right angles to the direction the users were facing. The imprecise targeting was frustrating for users.</p><p>After the study was completed, the problem was fixed by adding a visible box to the ray, which is used to check for intersections. The box is used to both indicate, to the user, the orientation and length of the ray and to check for intersections. The improved approach allows for a certain amount of error in the tracker readings on the wand, and makes it easier for users to zap hazards.</p><p>Six participants said that the problem with hazard zapping was their least favorite part of the whole training experience. However, several students mentioned zapping as one of their favorite parts of the training experience, demonstrating that the interaction method is compelling to young users.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">User experience observations</h3><p>One surprising issue that was encountered was getting the children to crawl in the virtual environment. The head tracking software adjusted the camera view when the Navigator knelt down, which allowed the children to see below the layers of smoke that were formed. The investigators believe that this capability of the virtual environment makes it especially useful for training the particular skill, however, many of the children were not used to this idea. Even after they were instructed to get on their knees they sometimes did not understand what to do. One child asked “How do I kneel?” This was an unexpected user-interface issue. Apparently, children who are used to playing video games expect to carry out activities within the game environment without actually physically engaging in the activity; the student who asked the question wanted to know “which button to press” to virtually kneel in the game. Although the issue needs to be addressed, the issue shows that immersive VR systems have a built-in capability for higher levels of actual human–computer interaction than traditional video games, which can increase capabilities for truly “hands-on” training experiences.</p><p>Younger children reported feeling fear in the virtual environment. The result indicates a greater level of realism and immersion than traditional fire-safety training methods and, therefore, a more powerful learning experience. As a result, using immersive VR as a part of the training experience may lead to greater learning gains over time for younger children. The investigators did not want to traumatize children during the fire-safety training program; however, a proper level of realism is necessary for safety training. Younger children also had a greater problem with feeling dizzy or with experiencing motion sickness.</p><p>In spite of the reported frustration associated with hazard zapping, most of the users enjoyed the experience. All participants were very excited when they were able to start playing the game. Most remarked that it was just like being inside a video game. Their increased enthusiasm for learning relatively standard fire-safety information fulfilled the primary goal of the study. The trainees’ enthusiasm demonstrated the promise of VR for training vital skills over other somewhat tedious methods.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec20"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec20-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec20">Conclusions and future work</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec20-content"><p>Fire safety is a difficult skill to evaluate because children need to be able to reproduce correct behaviors under highly specialized fire situations. Demonstrating correct behavior in a classroom setting does not necessarily translate to real-world situations. VR applications show promise for providing the means for training fire-safety skills, in a safe environment, which might later be needed in dangerous situations.</p><p>In an initial related test, children indicated that they wanted to be able to explore a virtual fire-safety training environment on their own. To address the issue, a game-based version of the fire-safety application was designed to be playable without the help of an adult navigator, or a firefighter. The second more-advanced version of the system provided users with a more immersive experience and made them active participants in the learning process. However, with the new system, students were alone, without firefighters, in their process of learning appropriate fire-safety procedures. For example, students themselves had to learn that crawling low would help them see.</p><p>On the other hand, the open nature of the VR facility seemed to allow and encourage children to talk to other people in the room. Children often asked their parents and others questions while they navigated in the VR environment. The uncontrolled interaction may have skewed test results, but may also have added to the users’ learning experiences.</p><p>From project results, the investigators demonstrated that immersive VR systems have a built-in advantage over prior fire-safety training methods for children. They allow children to experience realistic virtual “hands-on” and “on-site” experiences for high-risk safety training, which cannot be achieved through lectures or regular video games, e.g., how to kneel down or crawl in a fire situation. In addition, study results show that game-based VR systems increase children’s motivation over more traditional teacher–learner forms of VR-based instruction, which was the primary goal of the study.</p><p>The results indicate, as have other related studies, that emerging VR capabilities may help create a new paradigm in learning: highly interactive, experiential, virtual-learning environments that can augment, enhance, or possibly replace traditional teacher–learner methods based upon lectures and videos. Learners apparently prefer the new learning paradigm.</p><p>As a result, as in the current study, future teachers may actually become virtual-learning system designers rather than lecturers and their main efforts may be focused on how to design their knowledge and teaching abilities into effective learning systems that both engage and motivate learners.</p><p>Study results also indicate that age of learners impacts system design needs. With respect to fire-safety training for children, users with age differences of as little as a few years apparently require different learning environments. In the current study, younger children reported more fright than older children. As a result, different fire simulations might be needed to allow adjusting experience intensity and realism for different age groups.</p><p>Different forms of learning evaluation are also needed. Younger students had a more difficult time completing the study quiz, and they became more frustrated with the forms that they had to fill out as part of the study. For younger children, one-on-one interviews might be a more effective evaluation format because written self expression might still be difficult for them.</p><p>In addition, the simplicity of the quiz, which was developed for the youngest users, may have prevented measuring any additional learning gains that may have been achieved by reinforcing video training with VR training. The retention rate of fire-safety knowledge due to the VR training component, versus traditional classroom video and/or personal interaction training techniques need further study, as well. The extent to which traditional learning methods can be replaced, rather than augmented or enhanced, by virtual learning environments needs to be determined.</p><p>In the future, the potential for using intelligent agents, which act as training guides, also needs to be explored. Other game-like elements could also be improved, to include more hazards and to make hazards and hazard placement more dynamic, so that different hazards would appear in different locations on successive runs of the program. The improved functionality could make the game more interesting for repeated training, since users would not know all the hazards and where they were located in the training environment.</p><p>Fire safety is a difficult skill to test in children because they may never need the skills. However, if children do find themselves in a fire emergency they are typically either prepared or they are not. The investigators believe that the children who participated in the program are better prepared in the event they experience a fire situation in their home. As a result, the study and the study results present a significant gain and step toward improved fire-safety training for children.</p></div></div></section>
