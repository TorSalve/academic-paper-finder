Today, Virtual Reality (VR) systems can benefit this process. By simulating different future alternatives, together with their possible environmental impact, a common understanding of the consequences of the respective alternatives can be obtained. Furthermore, since many of the models are obtainable from the Internet, a wider public can be reached already in the early phases of the planning process. The goal of the paper is to provide a better understanding of the use of VR models for supporting involvement and collaboration in the road planning process. The background data are from two large road planning projects through cultural heritage areas in Sweden. Observations on using VR models to support public participation, and facilitate communication between different interested parties, are presented. The results argue for the benefits of using VR models during the whole road planning process and shed further light on a range of social issues associated with using this technology.</p></div></div></section>

Besides different interested parties, many people living in the area are involved in the process. Proper visualization tools are needed to evolve a useful dialogue in and between these different groups. Today, there are several virtual reality (VR) systems for simulation of large-scale environments available on the market and their use has increased (Bishop and Lange <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Bishop I, Lange E (eds) (2005) Visualization in landscape and environmental planning.

By visualizing a realistic model around the users at actual scale, it is possible to explore large constructions such as roads already before they are built. However, apart from having many benefits, applying VR systems can cause misunderstandings due to differences in the users’ background, expertise, or interests.</p><p>Even though the aim of virtual reality systems is not necessarily to achieve graphic realism (Stanney <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Stanney KM (2002) Handbook of Virtual Environments.

The realistic representations help people with diverse backgrounds and interests to establish a common ground about problems and possibilities in relation to understanding environmental changes (Lange <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Lange E (2005) Issues and questions for research in communicating with public through visualizations.

Since VR-based models cannot be fully realistic in all parameters, on of the most significant questions is how realism and abstraction in VR models need to be approached for these types of applications (Heldal <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Heldal I (2004) The Usability of Collaborative Virtual Environments: Towards an Evaluation Framework.

For example, it is known that different groups of professionals use graphical models differently depending on their background (Whyte and Bouchlaghem et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Whyte J, Bouchlaghem D, Thorpe T (1999) Visualization and information: a building design perspective.

Sketches, used in the early phases of a planning process, can show simulated effects deviating from the effects that the users will experience with the new road. A sketch may mean different things for different individuals and groups (Vicente <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Vicente KJ (1999) Cognitive work analysis toward safe, productive, and healthy computer-based work.

Useful sketches for a landscape architect cannot be equally useful for people interested in preserving history, which may differ again from the usefulness of these sketches for rescue experts. Therefore, not only to better support collaboration, but also to avoid confusion, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the effects of using these models.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to improve understanding of the use of VR models for supporting collaboration in the road planning process. A special focus is on finding the needs for specific solutions or adjustments depending on the role of various users. The background data come from two large road planning projects in Sweden. These new roads also influence cultural heritage areas.</p><p>The article is structured as follows. The section “Supporting road planning processes” draws a concise picture of the road planning process, the section “Brief consideration on VR models supporting environmental planning” describes VR models used in environmental planning, and section “Study design” presents methodological considerations and the experimental studies. Sections “Utilizing VR: initial experiences” and “Engaging the public and professionals in using VR models” include results from observations, from questionnaires and from interviews made with different professionals and the public, the section “Discussion and future directions” discusses these results and future trends, and the last section presents the conclusions.</p><p>One of the limitations of the study is that it does not follow the entire decision-making process between all the actors. It follows the planning phase, focusing on observations from those meetings that address a large group of the population and/or many different experts. However, it was not possible to attend all meetings for or between small groups. Some of the preliminary observations were presented earlier (Heldal and van Raalte et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Heldal I, van Raalte S, Balot K (2005) Using virtual reality systems to support public participation in planning new roads.

New roads are built and old ones are transformed to suit better new requirements. Road planning is a complex process that is estimated to take 7–15 years. It undergoes four major phases: two for road planning (pre-study and inquiry) and two for road design (work planning and final design). First comes the pre-study where a decision is made about the delimitation of the inquiry region, problem and conflict areas are identified, and the main alternative solutions are suggested. In this phase a description of possible consequences and of the protected cultural and natural heritage is also produced. Once the best solution is decided, the inquiry phase takes over and the choice of a road corridor about 300–500 m wide is made. After this, a work plan is made that will give a more detailed description of where the road area is situated and what it should look like. Here the consequences for the environment are more exactly described. The last phase is the final design and construction plan for the building project, including technical descriptions and instructions, and functional requirements (Wolffram <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Wolffram B (2001) Vägutredning—Slutrapport (Road Investigation—Final Report), Vägverket, Gothenburg" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR45" id="ref-link-section-d39863e332">2001</a>).</p><p>Valid environmental decisions reflect the theory and practice of decision-making. These include steps such as correct definition of requirements, alternative solutions while recognizing the limits of scientific knowledge, and current regulatory and political influences (Pidgeon and Gregory <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Pidgeon NF, Gregory R (2004) Judgment, decision making and public policy. In: Koehler D, Harvey N (eds) Handbook of judgment and decision making, Oxford, pp 604–23" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR31" id="ref-link-section-d39863e338">2004</a>). In order to build a road that is suitable for the population, several interests have to be considered and possible conflict situations resolved. There are, for example, politicians, road engineers, managers, municipalities, nature- and culture-experts, rescue experts, and media involved (Wolffram <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Wolffram B (2001) Vägutredning—Slutrapport (Road Investigation—Final Report), Vägverket, Gothenburg" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR45" id="ref-link-section-d39863e341">2001</a>). All of these groups represent specific, often contradictory interests, but have to agree upon one solution. Priorities and compromises must be adopted in relation to fair resource management and sustainable environmental development (Persson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Persson J (2006) Environmental assessment, Conflicts and Communication in Planning and Management.

For example, how can the heritage area be preserved best if the safest (for evacuation, access to rescue helicopters, ambulances, etc.) road alternative goes right through it?</p><p>When planning a new road, one major aspect to consider is the values of the natural and cultural heritage. Today, communication of these values between the integrated conservator of built environments and the exploiters is a common problem (van Raalte and Wallin <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="van Raalte S, Wallin M (2003) IT i kulturmiljöer—En kunskapsöversikt (IT in Culture Heritage Environments—A Survey). Report, Dept. of Innovative Design, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR25" id="ref-link-section-d39863e350">2003</a>). The conservators experience that it is hard to get response for their opinions in the planning process, just as the exploiters have difficulties in understanding and interpreting the cultural heritage sector’s views and argumentation. This is usually because the data are not able to undoubtedly show in which ways the cultural heritage will be affected by the new development (Owen and Buhalis et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Owen R, Buhalis D, Pletinckx D (2004) Identifying technologies used in cultural heritage.

If the values of the cultural heritage can be made more clearer and understandable, the teamwork and the dialogue between different groups in the planning process can be improved. Looking at the data and working procedures used today, digital visualization could indeed be used to communicate more effectively also on cultural heritage aspects (Antonsson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Antonsson H (2004) Hur kommuniceras kulturmiljön?

For example, specific spatial decision-support systems (SDSSs) were developed to deal with geographical, environmental, and available public data (Keenan <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Keenan PB (2002) Spatial information systems.

Due to the huge amount of information, the variety of user groups representing different interests, and the complexity of the systems, these are rarely used. There are studies that warn against an unbridled rush by organizations to adopt these systems (Baltes and Dickinson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Baltes BB, Dickinson MW, Sherman MP, Bauer CC, LaGanke JS (2002) Computer-mediated communication and group decision making: a meta-analysis.

Examples of such dynamic data that can be represented and adjusted in the VR models are: cultural and natural heritage aspects, safety requirements, noise and sight analysis, seasonal variations, pollution, traffic scenarios, housing availability, etc. Technologies and applications have been developed that show their benefits for a large variety of fields, from coastline visualization (Jude and Brown et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Jude SR, Brown I et al (2005) Exploring future coastlines—Initial steps towards the development of an integrated coastal simulation and visualisation system.

An interesting trend is the entrance of collaborative communities and games in this field. Communities are becoming popular since they allow distributed communication and collaboration (Shiffer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Shiffer M (2001) Spatial multimedia for planning support.

Some of them are based on realistic data obtained by geographic information systems (GIS) for work (Sarjakoski <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Sarjakoski T (1998) Networked GIS for public participation—Emphasis on utilizing image data.

The complex contextual information usually impresses participants and helps them to reach a better <i>common</i> understanding of the changes. This understanding provided by VR models has to correlate with the real changes (Mahmoud et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Mahmoud AH, Clayden A, Higgin C (1999) A comparative study of environmental cognition in a real environment and its VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) simulation.

The concurrent use of pictures and words also supports communication and decision-making (Rehal <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Rehal S (2004) Bild och ord som verktyg för dialog (Images and Words as Tools for Supporting Dialogues).

However, many service components concentrate more on developing the technology, and not on identifying social implications of the choice of the technology for different user groups. The project Intelcities’ reports ended with several remarks on further need for investigation of how planning processes and social processes can be interrelated (James et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="James P, Fernando T, Hamilton A, Curwell S (2004) Enhancing the decision-making process in urban spatial planning using advanced ICT.

Relevant here is the fact that a knowledge society will contribute positive benefits by “reinforcing the need to avoid negative potentialities, e.g. through increased social exclusion” (Curwell and Hamilton <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Curwell S, Hamilton A (2003) Intelcity Roadmap—Version 4, EU project report &#xA;                    http://www.ndmodelling.scpm.salford.ac.uk/intelcity/documents/documents.htm&#xA;                    &#xA;                  &#xA;                        " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR14" id="ref-link-section-d39863e502">2003</a>, p. 13). In the present state of the art, it is not clear how VR systems support the integration of the real world into the virtual for different user groups (Al-Kodmany <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Al-Kodmany K (2002) Visualization tools and methods in community planning: from freehand sketches to virtual reality.

Furthermore, it is not possible to have an overview on the whole road planning process, while having access only to arbitrary details.</p><p>There is a large variety of different VR systems on the market. There are many non-immersive, desktop-based VR systems, e.g. Urbansim<sup>5</sup>, augmented reality-based systems, e.g. Arthur<sup>6</sup>, and immersive CAVE<sup><a href="#Fn9"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>-type systems, e.g. landscape visualization<sup>2 </sup>at Groningen University. However, the lifetime of these systems can be much shorter than the time for planning a highway. The models also have to interpret some issues exactly, while just sketching others (Lange <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Lange E (2005) Issues and questions for research in communicating with public through visualizations. In: Buhmann E, Paar P, Bishop I, Lange E (eds) Proceedings at anhalt university of applied sciences trends in real-time landscape visualization and participation. Wichmann Verlag, Heidelberg, &#xA;                    http://www.masterla.de/conf/pdf/conf2005/11lange_c.pdf&#xA;                    &#xA;                  &#xA;                        " href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d39863e527">2005</a>). The precision of representation can differ from a user group to another. Therefore, for these VR systems it is not enough following usual usability evaluation methods that explore the benefits and drawbacks of the new functionalities. They have no expert and novice users, but user clusters with different expertise. More studies are needed to answer questions like: Which are the most suitable technologies for a specific planning project? In which phase should what application or technique be used? What are the differences between the impacts of different available technologies? What are the impacts of the different simplifications? These differences have to be formulated, not only in technical and economic terms, but also in relation to, for example, risks, human safety and social impact of the use (Wilson <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Wilson JR (2003) If VR Has Changed then have its Human Factors?

To answer these questions one has to investigate how social issues associated to decisions in the road planning process can be better supported by technology and how complex social issues can shape designing more usable technologies. This is considered to be one of the important research questions for e-Science<sup><a href="#Fn10"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> of today (Woolgar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Woolgar S (2003) Social shaping perspectives on e-science and e-social science: the case for research support.

Using the context of the innovation diffusion theory (Rogers <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Rogers EM (1995) Diffusion of innovations.

Also, knowing that individuals (groups) in a social system adopt innovations in sequences, the objective is to discuss the adoption sequences in terms of user (group) characteristics and the previously described dimensions. In order to understand future directions of using VR systems, according to Rogers, one has to know the technology, the attitude towards it, how public and professionals accept (or reject) it, how the innovation can be used, and whether people support the use of it. Furthermore, questions such as non-adoption and non-use needs to be discussed (Mente-Mejer and Klamer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Mente-Mejer E, Klamer L (2004) ICT capabilities in action: what people do.

Thus, to answer the main question “How can VR models better support overall participation for planning future road?” one has to know:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">

We examined the activities which the Swedish Road Administration (SRA) carried out to inform the public and different professionals<sup><a href="#Fn11"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>, primarily about the availability and benefits of using VR models. Working together with the project leaders responsible for the respective road planning projects, we designed the study to collect data on the use of VR models via (1) participatory observations during information meetings with public and experts, (2) participatory observations at the exhibitions in municipalities (Argyris et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1985" title="Argyris C, Putnam R, Smith D (1985) Action science.

                        <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Data collected</h3><p>During the studies we had continuously contact with the project leaders. They were interviewed before each project. The interviews, each 2–3 h long, were about their experiences with the used VR models. Data from observations were collected from five different meetings: three with the public and two with experts. Three of the public meetings concerned the road project <b>R</b> (the first meeting with 58 and the second with 42 participants) and the road <b>S</b> (for 51 participants). The fourth and fifth meetings were about showing the VR model to experts from the municipality, authorities, different interested parties, and media from Söderköping, Norrköping and Linköping<sup><a href="#Fn12"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> (19 and, respectively, 13 experts). Each meeting took approximately three hours, including a 30-minute break. During the break people could and did use the VR models. Additionally we followed two arbitrary working days activities at the user kiosks in Tanum and Söderköping. Notes were taken about the activities and comments at the meetings and user kiosks.</p><p>Data from questionnaires were collected from experts on their experiences of different supporting tools for decision-making in general, for both the <b>R</b> and the<b> S</b> projects. A questionnaire with open-ended questions was sent to the experts (18 of 26 responded). They had to describe their expertise and answer 10 questions on the differences between using maps, paper models, photomontages, orthophotos and how they experienced the VR models. They had to describe the benefits of using the VR model and also possible worries that they believe that the use of it can cause.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Used technologies</h3><p>The traditional visualization tools—maps, paper models, photomontages, orthophotos, and scaled mock-ups—were available for both projects. These “user kiosks” were available for the public at the corresponding municipalities 2–3 months before the public meetings together with the VR models on a desktop computer.</p><p>The VR models used for both projects were based on RoadView<sup>™</sup>, a large-scale visualization software using advanced multitexturing<sup><a href="#Fn13"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#Fig5">5</a>). It was developed for organizations working with projects related to infrastructure changes. The interface aims to be intuitive and usable for non-technical experts. It runs on Windows-based computers rendering high-fidelity 3D terrain databases in OpenFlight™, TerraPage™, or VTree™ format. Such an “ordinary” desktop computer at the end of 1999 had a processor with at least 1 GHz, graphic cards with 3D acceleration, and 512 Mb RAM. The size of the model was approximately 1 Gb.

                        <p>By converting geographical data (GIS) together with images from photographs (generating the right textures), and CAD data on buildings, bridges, tunnels and road geometry, RoadView generates models for real-time interaction and visualization of road planning scenarios. The users can interact in the models: they can click on possible roads, choose the interesting information and see the effects of their choice. For example they can choose viewpoints, quick-jump to specific waypoints, and select different geographic information, for example geology, noise levels, cultural data, season-specific environments, etc. They can select a point in the 2D-map window and move to the corresponding place in the 3D world. For better orientation when moving in the 3D world, the 2D-map window can indicate positions and directions. The users can fly over a road or drive on it (in a car), choose the visibility, speed, and the density of the traffic on the road. Also they were allowed to evaluate different road solutions in scenarios, such as different geographic information layers and traffic situation. One could also choose to jump to see pre-recorded viewpoints or could follow animations throughout a road corridor.</p><p>For better accessibility<sup><a href="#Fn14"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> two VR models with different sizes were made generally accessible on the Internet and by CD distribution. For the <b>R</b> project, around 600 CDs were sent to the public, and many to other interested groups. This number was approximately 300 for the <b>S</b> project. The CDs also contained video clips on each road suggestion. The larger models were used in the first instance at meetings organized by the SRA for the public and professional experts. During these meetings large projections on large screens were also used. There were user-kiosks in both areas (in the municipal buildings) where visualization material was available for the public during working hours. During given hours, experts from SRA and from the company that developed the VR model were present here in order to discuss questions and possible problems.</p><p>Since the initial VR model for <b>R</b> was developed approximately at the same time as RoadView, the cost for it was large. The next projects were much cheaper. Today, the price<sup><a href="#Fn15"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> for visualizing 5–6 possible alternatives for a road in pre-study is approximately 6,000 Euros, for the feasibility study additionally 12,000 Euros, and for detailed work plans a further 12,000 Euros. Since data from one phase can be reused in the next, a model ordered directly for the detailed work plans adds up to 21,000 Euros. A model used at this phase contains the most details, and it is more easily developed if the models for the previous phases exist.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec8"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec8-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec8">Utilizing VR: initial experiences</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Introducing VR in the road planning process in Sweden</h3><p>In Sweden, the first VR model supporting participation in road planning processes was ordered by the SRA at the end of 1998 by the project leader of the <b>R</b> project. During four prior years, several expert groups and the public could not reach a common decision on where a new road should be planned, and SRA could not propose an alternative road to the government. There were intensive discussions in the daily media and official papers, but the interested parties could not agree upon a solution. This, together with information about the usefulness of VR as a visualization tool, motivated the project leader to order it. An additional motivation was to make possible solutions and its consequences accessible for a wider public. The original idea was to build a VR model about the suggestions and their impact as realistic as possible. Current information was collected (GIS data, orthophotos, and photos) and checked with maps and already existing digital resources. Using the VR model a few years, a suggested road alternative was chosen and proposed to the government.<sup><a href="#Fn16"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> The project leader for <b>S</b> introduced the model after he was informed about the success of the application used for <b>R</b>. In comparison to the previous project, this model was introduced quite early in the project planning, already after a few months.</p><p>The project leaders ordered the given VR models, and expected clear benefits from it. They were aware that they had to continuously update it. During this time, the person responsible for leading the corresponding road construction project at the SRA was also responsible for using the visualization tools proper for the project. For example, we met another project leader who decided to build an extra parking place instead of ordering a 3D model or VR application. Today leading road construction projects are different at SRA. There are several project leaders responsible for a project.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Access to VR models</h3><p>The VR models were used extensively during the meetings. An intention of the meetings was that people with different backgrounds should discuss with each other. “This meeting provides basic data for the decision-making process: which road alternatives should we choose?” (project leader for<b> S</b>) At each meeting some professional experts from the municipal councils, and some others working on environmental issues in the area, described more concretely the known benefits and drawbacks of each suggested road alternative. This took approximately 1 h. After that, the project leaders made clear to the audience that the purpose of using VR is to better understand the choice of a new road corridor, and they encouraged the people to try the freely available models and asked them for feedback. Both project leaders introduced some basic concepts of the benefits of the VR models by illustrating these: “Now you’ve seen the alternatives. We can now drive on the roads or we can fly over them.” “And now I can follow a truck. I’m just glued on it. I can change the speed and also change the load of the traffic on the road.” “Yes, it would be great to have a resting place somewhere here. What do you think?” Or “Would you like to choose some other viewpoint?<i>”</i>
                        </p><p>People could download these models from the Internet, install from CDs, or use the test versions available at municipalities or at SRA. At some peak times in the beginning there were people queuing to try the VR models. At one user kiosk presentation, a boy aged 10–11 drew the model directly, without any guidance. To the question how he experienced the VR model, he said: <i>“Oh, great, it’s only a pity that you can’t win something.”</i>
                        </p><p>At the official meetings and with the user kiosks many people tried (most often with help from the person responsible for technical support) almost all functionalities offered by RoadView. They often measured length, height, angles. They also checked noise level, weather conditions, and visibility between two geographical points. People did not use the function pre-recording and playing again navigation scenarios. Many younger people tried high speed navigation.</p><p>Even though people were informed (by official letters) that they could download the VR model from the Internet, only 10% of the participants at the meetings said that they tried it and only a few of these succeeded in running it. None of the experts at the meetings or answering the questionnaires did so either. To the question “Would you like to run the VR models by yourself?” from the questionnaire, only five experts answered <i>yes</i>, and three answered <i>“yes, if the technology will be easier”.</i> Many of those who answered <i>yes</i> argued that the model would be useful and support internal group meetings by better showing individual suggestions, even in smaller groups within their own working contexts. Some of the experts in archaeology and landscape architecture explained that they do not try to run the VR model since it seems too complicated. Many experts remarked that VR has several benefits; it does not replace any other traditional visualization tools, but they would be happy to use it as a complement. Even if they themselves did not use the models, the experts appreciated that “One can download these models from the Internet” (a professional from Linköping municipality). Further, a general comment after the meetings was: “The model can be modified more easily and show different preferences regarding detail information.”</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Showing the benefits of dynamic information in real time</h3><p>The project leaders showed the benefits of changing the viewpoints in the model: “Look at this. We are going to Gårdens sten [the name of a place]. Now we are looking around. You can see exactly how much of the road you will see from the different viewpoints. Now we are 12 m high. Here is the second alternative, where the road will be approximately 260 m farther away. You can see now, again, what you are seeing from this point of the road...and different views again.”(the project leader for <b>S</b> project) During the demonstrations the people talked to each other, pointed to different parts of the model, and questioned the meeting leader, the person who drew the model or their neighbors. Some very typical questions were: “What can you see from place X?”, “What about if I’m on top of the roof there?”, “Can we go to the house of Z and see the road from that place?”, “Can I see the effect of the noise and exhaust pollution, with my house (garden, cottage, land, etc.)?” There were three houses that certainly have to be moved for the project <b>R.</b> To move the house physically in the model and see the new possible surroundings was a requirement from several people at the meetings, during both meetings in Tanum.</p><p>The project leaders were pleased that by changing viewpoints, traffic density, and weather conditions, the archaeology professionals could eventually be convinced more easily about the trespass of the new road. They experienced problems in convincing these experts. These may also result from the fact that, historically, not only the objects on the surface count, but also existing or possibly existing remains from under the surface. Many of the professionals in archaeology mentioned that object details, especially associated with the rock carvings, are important, e.g. “I would like to distinguish more easily and see surfaces, to understand the place better. I would like to check a stone’s profile better and also to see cross-sections.” In the context of preserving cultural heritage, comparisons with reality were raised many times: “I think the model has to contain more details in order to visualize truly the influence on cultural heritage.” Visualizing exactly some negative influence of a new road was also mentioned in this context: “Experiencing faraway objects and small objects was strange in VR. Not like in reality. When it is about changes that influence heritage, the details are more important. I would like to see how the abstract visualization (noise, pollution, radiation) influences smaller or bigger objects. I would like to see the limits of these abstract things on a flower or a leaf.”</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">VR versus other visualization</h3><p>Members of the public generally asked for more details in relation to their own houses and neighborhoods. Several of them mentioned that the VR models are too rigid. They required people in the environment in order “to use them” as reference objects: “I would like to have more reference objects, people in the environment. Sometimes I had a hard time following and understanding scales. Yes. Going forward 3 m and flying up 10 were exactly the same experience”, said the project leader for the <b>R </b>project<i>.</i> Both people from the area and experts wished to incorporate in the models other statistical information on the number of affected cottages or how these would be affected, etc.</p><p>To the question from the questionnaire “Did the VR help you to believe that your preference of an alternative was more secure, more accurate, and quicker?” The professionals could answer for each <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>, and they had to justify each of their choice in their own words. The number of <i>yes</i> answers for more secure was four, for more accurate 12 and for quicker 17. The main justification was that VR models seem to give a good overall understanding of the effect of the changes—despite uncertainty as to how secure VR is, since the visualized data can be misunderstood more easily by the public. This is especially important in the early phases of projects. “It has to be granted that the VR model represents reality” (an expert working with environmental impact analysis), although many of the other people formulated this message in other terms.</p><p>As a general benefit, many of the experts (nine) mentioned the advantages of visualizing the overall view on the effects of decisions. Some examples: “I think it was easier to get into the different alternative solutions and have an overall understanding of the model” (a landscape architect). People as a whole at each meeting mentioned the value of choosing several viewpoints. Many experts remarked this in the questionnaires as well. “It is good to see the changing information through a line together with experiencing changes in height. There are arguable points on each road that you can understand in this way.” (Landscape architect) Some comments from the public were about placing the road in context: “It is easier to see what is next to the roads.” (the project leader for the <b>R</b> project.)</p><p>Some of the experts (from municipalities and plan-, road- or landscape architects) mentioned that the use of a visualization influences how one views the other visualization possibilities and the way one understands high altitudes. Some other experts (archaeologists, landscape architects), in contrast, thought that the photomontages visualize the 3rd dimension more comprehensibly: “I like photomontage better; it shows the character of the place. We are used to seeing 2D and understanding the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension by using the photomontages. Unlike these the VR models are more rigid, they are more flat.” However, these latter comments may be a result of long-time experience.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec13"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec13-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec13">Engaging the public and professionals in using VR models </h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Observations in the meeting rooms</h3><p>The public participated very actively in discussing the models when the technician ran them, following inquiries from the project leader and other people in the meeting room. At one of the meetings, the public took over the control from the project leader spontaneously several times and steered the technical assistant in different directions, or asked her to show specific views, etc. Some typical questions were: “Could you please go there and see how the view will be changed? Could you please fly over the house and see it? Do you know if the noise influences my house, which is...?”, or “Can you measure the distance from alternative 2 here?” Moreover, people requested additional information on the connections to the existing road.</p><p>Many of the questions were about priorities regarding building the new roads, e.g. which part would be built at what time. “If we do this part after the road is done there, before people can drive up to it at very high speed, especially at this point there can be a danger. It may result in many accidents.” (The project leader for the <b>S</b> project) At both meetings with the public, the roads were loaded with trucks. People asked about other transportation as well. Many who were living in a rural area in the Tanum region asked: “And how does this scenario look when I drive my tractor?” Similarly, people liked to know where and how the lay-by areas on the side of the road were going to be built, and they wanted to experience crossroads.</p><p>By using VR the public understands overall changes more easily. They can even influence the design of new VR models and also have an impact on designing future roads. This can be illustrated by the story that the project leader for the S project told the public at each meeting: “X (a person living in the area) had a great idea. The road from his house crosses the main road here. We thought that we would build the crossroads here, at the same place. But he suggested we should build it here instead (pointing to another place). I agree, it is better for him and does not influence the whole road in a negative way. Maybe, on the other hand, here (pointing again) it will be safer for everybody to cross the main road.”</p><p>When seeing the enthusiasm and engagement among the public, some of the experts became worried: “One cannot treat VR models as movies, even if they look realistic” was a common remark from them. When members of the public asked too specific questions, e.g. about the effect of the pollution on their cottages, there were experts arguing that at this stage one could not possibly know such information exactly.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15">Opinions from the experts</h3><p>In the questionnaires, we asked the experts if the real-time experience of driving on the road with different speeds and loads gave them additional information. Many of them appreciated this, especially if they did not work in the planning group: “I now understand better the changes experienced with the new roads. In my profession, experiencing this was not an issue before, and I’m glad that I’ve seen it” (an expert in environmental impact). Another wrote: “I think people experience the future roads almost as real. It will certainly be a disappointment if it does not become in reality as it was shown in the model.” (Landscape architect.)</p><p>We asked the experts if they could forecast some negative implications of the model used. Its price was, of course, a common objection. Otherwise they were happy that they could use the model. “I don’t think that the VR model has so many limitations. After all, it is an additional visualization method. Also maybe the price or the fact that people misinterpret it.” (Plan architect.) One expert in municipalities and one from the local media thought that VR contributes to information overflow, and another, a plan architect, was worried about problems caused by inconsistencies between the different models: “VR is an additional tool. It is great that one can make changes more readily on these, but they can easily result in inconsistencies between the different models used. One has to know all the time which of the models is valid.”</p><p>Many experts became worried when seeing the roads almost ready in the models, although at this stage only the corridor was planned. “According to the experiences presented in the VR models, the new roads can be understood quite as given. One may think that it will look, and affect the environment, exactly as they’ve seen in the model. This is not true. Many additional changes not yet seen can come in until the new road is ready.” (Comment from the local authorities from Linköping and people working with environmental impact.) How one can interpret future changes based on the simulated roads, which are shown nearly ready, is important especially since a VR model can be used most during the early phases of the project, and the ultimate result may differ from early models. “When we discuss the corridors, the information can be ambiguous. When a person at the end observes that the road is 50 m closer to her or his house, which is fully possible in contrast to the information visualized in the model, there may be protests and we will have to deal with indignation as a result.”</p><p>Both project leaders from SRA were worried about the too high expectations from the experts in the cultural sectors. “Sometimes people have such high expectations for details that we miss—not only the overview, but also the theoretical connections with other groups. Sometimes people do not understand that the VR models are like sketches, and they should not treat these differently.” The last remark was made in relation to simulating “the feeling of history” as requested by one archeologist.</p><p>The main motivation for introducing VR models, from the project leaders’ viewpoint, was to save resources by making shorter the road planning process. They knew already from the beginning that, for example: “To adjust photomontages in order to reflect recent changes is too expensive during the time period. You have to do expensive new photo montage for every change. This can be expensive during the period.” (The project leader for the <b>S</b> project.) “I knew when I ordered the first VR model that it would be expensive. And I knew that this money would be saved in time, since it was the first and every new VR model will be less expensive, as we already have knowledge and resources that we can build on.” (The project leader for the <b>R</b> project.) Both project leaders recognized that many of the problems originated in the clumsy technologies, worries about trying new computer systems, and the low home-computer performance at the beginning of the millennium. However, even if people do not use it by themselves, they experience easier communication with the different groups, thanks to the VR models. Additionally: “I think it is interesting to follow the people exploring by themselves in the models. By following their movement I understand what people think is important.” (The project leader for the <b>R</b> project.)</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec16"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec16-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec16">Discussion and future directions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec16-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Support for increased participation</h3><p>The main differences between the meetings concerned the location where the meeting was held and the occupations of the people from the two areas. The people living in the <b>R</b> area were mostly in a rural area, working with agriculture. They had more specific questions about the forests, domains, and different parts of the countryside than did people at the meetings in <b>S</b>. At all three meetings the public engaged in discussion on the effects of final results. At two of the meetings the observers had the sensation that people treated the models as a movie on real places. In contrast, during the meeting with the experts they often focused on the benefits and drawbacks of VR technologies in general. More often they had technical questions on basic data used to build the VR models, as well as on availability and limitations of computers needed to use it. They explained positive attitudes toward the VR models, but also worries, for example, on dizziness during operation.</p><p>Acquiring a product and not using it is confirmed by other studies as well (Mante-Mejer and Klamer <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Mente-Mejer E, Klamer L (2004) ICT capabilities in action: what people do. Report COST Action 269, Luxembourg" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR27" id="ref-link-section-d39863e1045">2004</a>). According to these authors a continuous use of services in relation to the technology would result in higher usage frequencies. A reason for the non-use may be that the study focused on the two very first VR models applied in Sweden for the first time. It was a large model, quite slow, and faced many usability problems too. Today there is a changing approach to VR systems, from the expectations of a “killer”—a super application for another reality—to the use of VR applications as specialized tools for specialized problems. The mass media in general present ever more alternatives, for example, for future bridges, buildings and other areas. The observations also show that people, in general, are ready to use the VR models. Considering the phases of innovation adoption (Rogers <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Rogers EM (1995) Diffusion of innovations. The Free Press, New York" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR33" id="ref-link-section-d39863e1048">1995</a>) we can make some interesting inferences. People have positive attitudes about VR technology, even if their knowledge of it discourages many potential users. Many asked concrete questions on how to download it, how much time it takes, how much time learning it requires, etc. These observations acknowledged that with the progress in networking, and the increased use of computers, VR is going to take a more intuitive place in our everyday life. Many people from Sweden have the possibility to use Internet and download programs. They are also interested to download programs; even they are not doing that yet.</p><p>In contrast to Baltes (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Baltes BB, Dickinson MW, Sherman MP, Bauer CC, LaGanke JS (2002) Computer-mediated communication and group decision making: a meta-analysis.

This can save time since joint decisions can be made earlier. However, to achieve this, people and also experts still need help to use the technology and run the VR models. The people during the meetings could also interact face-to-face, and directly explain possible concerns to each other. This interaction was very valuable since people immediately got responses on their own suggestions. The experts also learned what the general opinion in the meeting room is, what kinds of questions people living in the area ask, on their main problems. Similarly, the exhibitions with the user kiosks were valuable because of the face-to-face contact. Thus, VR cannot replace face-to-face meetings for participating and understanding road planning yet, but it is valuable for effectively supporting communication between different parties.</p><p>The effective communication is important, in accordance with other studies as well (Lange <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Lange E (2005) Issues and questions for research in communicating with public through visualizations.

For example, the visualization of the cultural heritage should be more interactive (van Raalte and Wallin <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="van Raalte S, Wallin M (2003) IT i kulturmiljöer—En kunskapsöversikt (IT in Culture Heritage Environments—A Survey).

A feasible idea may be to combine the VR models with SDSS systems (Keenan <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Keenan PB (2002) Spatial information systems. In: Mora M, Forgionne GA, Gupta JNG (eds) Decision making support systems: achievements, trends and challenges for.

In: Proceeding of international conference on information visualization, IV1999, London, UK, pp104–109" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR44" id="ref-link-section-d39863e1072">1999</a>). This also suggests that, in relation to designing VR models, the communication channels within and between the expert groups should be examined and considered; e.g. the high detail expected from the archaeological experts points to increased graphical requirements. Since technology cannot be designed without clear requirements from the diverse user groups, archaeologists should contribute, for example, with better information on the requested level of detail in relation to the phase of the road planning process. The accuracy of archaeological data should depend, not only on the different phases in the road planning process, but also on the experts with whom those archaeologists communicate. These questions raise larger issues about the aims, development and uses of VR systems—such as whether the aim should be more intuitive devices and greater realism. A main benefit of applying VR models, described by the experts, was exploration of differences in height. In the study performed by Mahmoud et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Mahmoud AH, Clayden A, Higgin C (1999) A comparative study of environmental cognition in a real environment and its VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) simulation.

Since height is important for many experts, a direct consequence should be exploring the possibilities of different VR systems for correct height estimation for everyone. Since correct height estimation is difficult when using GIS, other models must be considered, e.g. laser scanning, containing more correct data on height.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Democratic road planning</h3><p>One has to keep in mind the use of low-level Desktop computers (with projectors), the slower Internet connection, and heavy graphics—for this project. Since the early of 2000 many more Swedish homes have access to faster broadband connection. This, together with the possibilities of using more advanced VR technologies that increase experiences of places, should benefit to better satisfy needs from different groups, and communication. Possible technologies that can be applied today are: immersive technologies, e.g. augmented reality (Broll et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Broll W, Lindt I, et al (2004) ARTHUR: a collaborative augmented environment for architectural design and Urban planning. J Virtual Real Broadcast 1:1–9" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0061-3#ref-CR11" id="ref-link-section-d39863e1087">2004</a>) or CAVE-type systems (Cruz-Neira et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1993" title="Cruz-Neira C, Sandin D, DeFanti T (1993) Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: the design and implementation of the CAVE.

Using more proper devices that allow distributed interaction in collocated situations (Aspin and Roberts <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Aspin R, Roberts D (2005) A model for distributed, co-located interaction in urban design/review visualization.

Furthermore, with the entrance and use grid”<sup><a href="#Fn17"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> technologies, in particularly the Access Grids<sup><a href="#Fn18"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>18</a></sup> video conferencing and video assistance should contribute to effective communication between expert groups. To make the applications more enjoyable for people in the area, it would help to implement challenging tasks from games and import suggested alternatives in game contexts. Not only using certain game engines, but also making the VR models compatible with some games, should attract attention to future use, especially for public users. Since there are many VR models built on game engines—see for example the study presented by Stock et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Stock C, Bishop ID, O’Connor A (2005) Generating virtual environments by linking spatial data processing with a gaming engine.

Today there are over 15 projects developing different sections for one and the same road use different VR models from different developers—having different benefits. Several projects tried to use online communities associated with these projects, to better support formal and informal communication. The use of virtual communities and discussion groups supporting public participation needs realistic technology, but the real challenge is to understand and visualize appropriately, so communication should be about representations, as observed by Sarjakoski. Approaching photorealism and 3D are important for increasing experiences (Sarjakoski <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Sarjakoski T (1998) Networked GIS for public participation—Emphasis on utilizing image data.

Considering the increasing distributed work in the construction industry (Stahre <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Stahre B (2006) How to convert reality into virtual reality: exploring colour appearance in digital models.

This remains a task for the future, since there are no such roads built. Following the last two phases defined by Rogers for innovation adoption were implementation and confirmation. Until the present stage, there are many new road planning processes initiated in Sweden that use an improved version of the VR model applied for the studies presented here. These indicate tendencies for adoption. In order to meet the demand for a sustainable society and to achieve common understanding for the decision-making process, the indicators for the negotiations should be made more explicit for the different groups. The observations on non-use also reveal issues regarding general problems of using ICTs for decision-making, for example how network-based VR systems used for planning should be made more accessible.</p><p>The projects suggest that SRA was able to gain support for its preferred solution through the use of VR modeling, and gain democratic consensus around its preferred solution. Questions can be posed further, however, regarding how VR technology was used to reach the decision. Also in VR, issues such as ‘framing’, ‘manipulation’ and ‘bias’ can occur, and a skillful presentation of decision alternatives may serve to influence decision-making toward a predetermined goal. As procedures for e-government are emerging and being pushed on the European level, this study suggests both new problems and challenges in the design of a policy process supported by IT. On a more general level, this case raises questions about simplistic expectations that the information society will positively contribute toward a more sustainable society in a wide sense.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Summing up</h3><p>In summing up observations and data from questionnaires and interviews we conclude that the main benefits of using VR models are: (1) increased understanding of environmental changes; (2) support for discussions about environmental changes; and (3) support for public participation. These benefits have also been recognized in landscape visualization projects (Bishop and Lange <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Bishop I, Lange E (eds) (2005) Visualization in landscape and environmental planning.

The representations of the objects involved are important for decisions aimed at preserving cultural heritage. To see the effects of changes that influence cultural heritage by using different views, accurate details, and real-time experiences is very helpful. But including historical representations in the planning process makes the demands on the visual quality of the VR systems higher. From all other professionals, this demand was also greater than for other representations, for example of objects in nature and settlements that can be schematically represented.</p><p>The possibility of rapidly reaching a common understanding in the early stages of the road planning process is beneficial. People living in the area can easily combine their good local knowledge with the experience of using the VR models. By knowing the surrounding places they can also suggest new alternatives. This appears to be one of the main advantages of utilizing VR models at public meetings. With the aid of VR models a fruitful dialogue with the general public can be opened. At the present stage VR models support participation with different face-to-face meetings, but cannot replace these.</p><p>A common understanding of the effects of the changes is attainable already in the beginning of the planning process. The majority of the experts involved in the process experienced that the dialogue with the public can be initiated much more quickly than by using traditional representations. VR models also supported the communication with other experts. By visualizing individual opinions and their effects, also the experts’ common agreements could be reached more easily. The decisions made in these projects were only for the road corridors, but people could experience the complete road sections in the VR models. Within one and the same corridor, the final place for a new road and its environmental influence still vary considerably. This variation may influence people differently. Therefore, to visualize the extremes for the same road depending on its place in the corridor would be beneficial in the future.</p><p>In the road planning process it is important that VR is used throughout all steps. For this purpose the work procedures have to be changed. They must follow the planning process and grow in accuracy with it. This would also make it easier for people with different expertise to communicate with each other. By utilizing a VR model some factors, together with their influences, can be visualized behind each expert solution.</p><p>The VR models of today require technical support since only a minority among the public, and among the experts, can download the model and run it by themselves. This puts an additional responsibility on today’s project leaders. Even so, the democratic process as an entity was functioning more smoothly when using VR, according to the project leaders. Their own opinion is also that the final highway solutions had gained in quality with the support of VR representations.</p></div></div></section>
