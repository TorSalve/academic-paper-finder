These studies have a primarily technological scope regarding the application of virtual reality for e-commerce. They focus on technical aspects of designing and implementing a virtual reality shopping environment, in terms of proposed architectures, tools and solutions. Such a technical research orientation leaves only a limited understanding of the social context and behavioral impacts of virtual reality e-commerce applications (Walsh and Pawlowski <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Walsh KR, Pawlowski SD (2002) Virtual reality: a technology in need of IS research.

Besides technological issues, the social context has to be part of these applications (Maamar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Maamar Z (2003) Commerce, e-commerce, and m-commerce: what comes next?

The shopping process in real life is a social one and therefore an e-commerce application should integrate elements from the social context, such as trust, one of the most prominent social aspects of shopping, in physical and online settings (Maamar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Maamar Z (2003) Commerce, e-commerce, and m-commerce: what comes next?

Virtual reality applications for e-commerce allow for the accommodation of the social context by simulating a real-world experience, especially in the case of virtual shopping mall environments. However, current literature on such applications does not examine the social context associated with online shopping activities (Maamar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Maamar Z (2003) Commerce, e-commerce, and m-commerce: what comes next?

While several studies include an evaluation of the virtual reality shopping environment they present, in terms of technical performance or efficiency, there is a lack of evaluations with respect to social factors such as trust. Thus, research on virtual reality applications for e-commerce needs to be extended to include their effect on social and behavioral issues, among which trust is one of major importance.</p><p>Trust is a critical success factor for e-commerce, with lack of trust being recognized as one of the greatest barriers inhibiting online commercial transactions. Building customer trust is a major challenge for online vendors and remains an open issue as to how it can be accomplished within an e-commerce environment. Current literature examines trust from the perspective of a variable that will determine a customer’s intended interaction with an online store and not of a dynamic, evolutionary process that continues during interaction. As such, research on building trust is limited up to the stage before the first or a follow-up interaction with an online store and is not addressed at the stage while the customer interacts within the e-commerce environment. While several research models have been proposed for building trust in e-commerce (Cheung and Lee <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="Cheung C, Lee MKO (2006) Understanding consumer trust in internet shopping: a multidisciplinary approach.

They focus on factors that influence trust so as to entice a customer in interacting with an online store. The effect of the interaction on trust has hardly been examined, in terms of web site characteristics, such as perceived site quality and ease-of-use, without explaining how these influence trust as it progresses during interaction. As such, how trust is built throughout the duration of a customer interaction within an e-commerce environment remains elusive.</p><p>In an attempt to jointly address these two issues, the objective of this paper is to provide an understanding of the potential of virtual reality e-commerce environments from a social standpoint, in terms of building customer trust and gaining acceptance over traditional web-based counterparts. The paper posits that virtual reality technologies can effectively be applied for online shopping environments, so as to offer a rich and sophisticated customer experience compared to conventional web stores and enable the formation of customer trust. The paper exemplifies this potential of using virtual reality in e-commerce settings by presenting and evaluating a prototype virtual shopping mall environment. The design of the environment has been informed by the principles derived by an empirically tested model for building trust in e-commerce. The model describes the formation of trust as a process which evolves gradually as customer interaction takes place. Based on the principles derived from the model, the functionality of an online shopping application, beyond covering typical transaction needs, should convey the e-vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability. The environment serves as an example of how the functionality of a conventional online store can be augmented using virtual reality to provide an advanced form of online shopping and project a vendor’s trust-building attributes, by offering a shopping experience that is close to the physical one. The prototype environment has been evaluated with an empirical study. Our findings show that a virtual shopping environment would be preferred by customers over a conventional web store for conducting e-commerce activities and would facilitate the assessment of the e-vendor’s trustworthiness. The results are interpreted along three major categories, similarity to a real-world shopping context, visualization and interaction, which are further analyzed into a number of characteristics explaining customer perceptions of the virtual environment. In addition, it is illustrated that customer trust is built gradually during interaction within the virtual environment as it progresses through discrete stages enabling the assessment of the online vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section a comprehensive review of the literature of virtual reality in e-commerce and trust in e-commerce is provided. The third section presents the research design of the study, including the trust-building principles followed for the design of the virtual mall prototype, which is described in the following section. The evaluation study of the prototype and the interpretation of the results are presented next. A discussion of the findings follows and the last section provides concluding remarks.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Literature review</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Virtual reality in e-commerce</h3><p>Virtual reality holds a promising potential for e-commerce applications (Maamar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Maamar Z (2003) Commerce, e-commerce, and m-commerce: what comes next?

Virtual reality technology allows for the development of electronic shopping environments which can realistically simulate physical ones. In addition, such environments provide enhanced functionality and interactivity and can address limitations of e-commerce transactions related to the lack of face-to-face interaction and direct product contact (Walsh <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Walsh KR (2002) Reducing distance in e-commerce using virtual reality.

As such, virtual reality environments can provide a new type of online shopping experience, which is closer to the real-world counterpart and superior to that offered in existing web stores. The application of virtual reality in e-commerce has recently received growing research attention, as a technically approached topic. The emerging body of literature examines the use of virtual reality for the design and implementation of e-commerce applications, suggesting solutions, architectures and tools. The use of virtual reality technologies has been proposed for the 3D virtual representation of stores (Chittaro and Ranon <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Chittaro L, Ranon R (2002) Dynamic generation of personalized VRML content: a general approach and its application to 3D e-commerce.

These models view trust as a variable explaining the variance in a customer’s intended behavior towards an e-vendor, whether a customer will engage in an interaction with an online store or not. They describe the formation of trust in terms of factors that influence it before a customer engages in the first or a repeat interaction with an online store. They examine the trust effect of factors that are shaped before or after interaction with an online store. The effect of customer interaction per se on trust has been addressed to a limited degree. Several models include interaction and web site characteristics as factors that affect trust, such as perceived site quality (Corbitt et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Corbitt BJ, Thanasankit T, Yi H (2003) Trust and e-commerce: a study of consumer perceptions.

However, they do not explain how such factors contribute to the building of trust during the customer interaction with an online store.

                     <p>As already mentioned, the first step of this research design was the development of a conceptual model describing trust building in e-commerce (step 1). Trust is approached as a multidimensional concept and is analyzed into a set of four trusting beliefs, the beliefs in the benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability of the e-vendor, trusting intention and trusting behavior. These constructs have been synthesized and theoretically interrelated, resulting in an integrated model and a vertical understanding of how customer trust is formed in e-commerce (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Fig2">2</a>).

                     <p>Trust formation is described as an evolving process that takes place before and during customer interaction with an online vendor. The model suggests that prior to interaction, reputation, in conjunction with attitude towards e-commerce affect trusting intention. Attitude towards e-commerce is the result of propensity to trust, perceived security and perceived privacy of the e-commerce context. The rest of the model describes trust formation as it continues during interaction with an online vendor. The model describes how trust is built during a customer’s interaction within an e-commerce environment, extending previous works, by making a clear distinction between trust constructs and showing how each trust construct is affected as the interaction progresses.</p><p>Trust evolves gradually as the interaction takes place. Interaction is analyzed in three stages reflecting a promise being made, enabled and kept by the online vendor. These three promise fulfillment stages are mapped into the set of services available by an online store. Making a promise is conducted through welcome, recommendations and search facilities. A promise is enabled through product and product-related information view, order placement and purchase/payment facilities. Keeping a promise involves the prompt and correct, physical or electronic, delivery of the order, including order-tracking mechanisms.</p><p>Trust—trusting beliefs, intention and behavior—is built during interaction, as the latter progresses through the three stages. Trusting intention is influenced by the promise that is made by the online vendor. Trusting intention in turn and the enabling of the promise made influence trusting behavior. The latter together with the keeping of the promise will determine customer’s satisfaction from the overall interaction with the online vendor. Finally, the three promise fulfillment stages and satisfaction from the overall interaction shape the trusting beliefs of the customer. Making a promise forms the trusting belief in the e-vendor’s benevolence, enabling the promise forms the trusting belief in the e-vendor’s competence, keeping a promise forms the trusting belief in the e-vendor’s integrity and satisfaction from the overall interaction forms the trusting belief in the e-vendor’s predictability. As such, customer beliefs in the benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability are built gradually, with each interaction stage as well as interaction as a whole building a specific trusting belief.</p><p>An empirical study has been performed to test the model and the depicted relationships (steps 2–4). A measurement instrument was developed and pretested to derive the refined final instrument which was used for the study (step 2). Data were collected by administering an online questionnaire to a sample of 132 university students on a postgraduate information systems course, yielding an effective response rate of approximately 86% (step 3). After establishing the validity of the instrument (step 4a), the hypothesized relationships were tested using multiple regression analysis (step 4b). The results provide empirical support for the relationships depicted in the model. The standardized path coefficients and the variance explained (<i>R</i>

                     <p>The model and the empirical results led to deriving design principles for trust-building shopping environments, as described in the following paragraphs (step 6). Considering the scope of this paper, it should be mentioned that we only focus on the constructs and the relationships involved in the three stages of promise fulfillment, i.e., the part of the model that describes trust formation during customer experience within the e-commerce environment.</p><p>According to the results of the empirical testing of this model, each stage of promise fulfillment has a separate impact on trust, by influencing, directly or indirectly, one of the trusting beliefs and intention about the vendor. Making a promise influences a customer’s trusting intention towards the online vendor and a trusting belief in the vendor’s benevolence. Enabling a promise affects a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s competence. Keeping a promise shapes a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s integrity. The overall interaction influences a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s predictability.</p><p>These findings show that the stages of promise fulfillment reflect vendor attributes which are assessed to form the respective trusting beliefs and intention. Based on the interaction characteristics and satisfaction yielding from it at each stage of promise fulfillment, the customer makes inferences about a vendor’s attributes reflected by that stage, i.e., benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability.</p><p>Thus, the functions underlying the stages of promise fulfillment, beyond enabling transactions with an online store, are the tools for exhibiting a vendor’s attributes and delivering a satisfying interaction so as to build customer trust. Welcome, recommendations and search mechanisms associated with making a promise are the means for showing benevolence. Satisfaction from the interaction with these mechanisms influences a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s benevolence. Facilities for order placement and payment related to enabling a promise are the vehicle for showing competence. Satisfaction from the interaction with these facilities influences a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s competence. Order tracking services, beyond the delivery of an order which can be out of an electronic context, are the channel for showing integrity. Satisfaction from the interaction with these services influences a customer’s trusting belief in the vendor’s integrity. As a whole, these services offer a way for showing predictability, with satisfaction from the overall interaction affecting a customer trusting belief in the vendor’s predictability. The functions of each interaction stage and their effect on building customer trusting beliefs are summarized in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Tab1">1</a>.
</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Relationship between interaction stages, functions and effect on trusting beliefs in an e-commerce environment</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x/tables/1"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                     <p>As such, we can identify two facets of the functionality associated with promise fulfillment in an electronic setting. The first facet is related to the type of services provided to the customer for his convenience in conducting transactions with a vendor, while the second is related to how these services are provided to clearly show evidence of a vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability to the customer so as to allow him to make respective attributions of the vendor. While the functionality of an online store enables the conduct of transactions, it is the way that this functionality is provided which enables the assessment of the vendor’s trustworthiness.</p><p>Therefore, our empirical work highlights that the functionality of an e-commerce environment should be delivered in a way so as to convey a vendor’s trust-building attributes, i.e., benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability and generate satisfaction from the interaction in order to shape customer trust. The remainder of this paper discusses how this can be feasible with a virtual reality shopping environment (steps 6–9). We present and evaluate a prototype e-commerce environment which has been designed based on the above principles to convey the list of attributes necessary for the building of trust utilizing virtual reality. The prototype developed is a limited version of an actual virtual mall, in functional and visual terms. Its purpose is not to implement a full and complete e-commerce system or to exactly simulate a real-world shopping environment, but to serve as a vehicle for showing how virtual reality can be used for developing online shopping environments so as to engender customer trust.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec6"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec6-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec6">Virtual reality for trust-building e-commerce environments: virtual shopping mall</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec6-content"><p>Informed by the model, we have developed E-scape, a prototype trust-building e-commerce environment using virtual reality and agent technology.

A customer is always in contact with the salesperson while he can freely navigate in the stores, virtually look and feel the 3D products and be aware of the presence of other customers. A customer has constant communication with his salesperson through a text-based chat mechanism. Using a set of natural language type of pre-specified phrases, a customer can engage in a personal dialog with his salesperson, which is not visible to others. Customers can also use the chat mechanism to interact with other avatars, customers or visitors, in the virtual mall.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Structure</h3><p>E-scape has been developed using the Active Worlds Internet-based platform of Activeworlds Inc., as a 3D virtual world within the Active Worlds Educational Universe (AWEDU), depicted in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Fig4">4</a>.

                        <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8">Implementation of the trust-building virtual mall</h3><p>The agent-mediated virtual environment enables customer interaction at three distinct levels depicting the functions of making, enabling and keeping promises and projects the online vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability. Salesperson agents have a multiple role in the virtual mall, which is reflected in these three levels. At the first level a salesperson agent helps in making a promise, by welcoming the customer at the virtual mall, recommending products, assisting in search for products and guiding the customer to the stores. At the second level the agent aids in enabling the promise, by following the customer in a virtual store, being at his disposal and by offering assistance in viewing and ordering products. At the third level the agent contributes to keeping the promise by helping the customer track the status of placed orders. In this section we analyze the implementation of the functions associated with promise fulfillment, explaining how virtual reality and agent technology were applied to provide for the contextual expressiveness needed so as to enable the formation of trust.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec9">Welcome</h4><p>When a customer visits the virtual mall, a salesperson agent appears which welcomes the customers and kindly offers to help him. The salesperson agent is exclusively dedicated to the customer as a personal shopping assistant. The customer can personally interact with his salesperson agent and converse with him using a predefined set of natural-type of language phrases. Even upon initiation, customer interaction is targeted towards satisfying the customer, showing goodwill and friendliness.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec10">Recommendations</h4><p>The salesperson collects information from the shopping mall stores and proactively presents selected advertising messages to the customer regarding business offerings, based on the customer profile. There are two types of recommendations, created based on customer’s product searches and purchases from previous visits. When the customer enters the virtual mall, the agent recommends products based on the characteristics derived from his previous purchases. The agent can also make suggestions based on previous visits and searches, but only after customer’s consent, to further demonstrate the e-vendor’s benevolent intentions. Using the chat facility for communicating with the salesperson agent, the customer is able to request information about the advertised offers and can be directed by the agent to the virtual store making a particular offer.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec11">Search</h4><p>The customer is able to declare his interest in a product to the salesperson agent, regardless of those advertised. The customer is able to make a request about a product and has the option to show his product-specific preferences to a number of criteria in a dialogue with the agent, seeking to increase his satisfaction. Then the agent performs a search based on the customer’s request and according to the specified preferences and characteristics and presents the results of the search. In this way the salesperson makes and communicates the promise to the customer. The search functionality of the agents is designed so as to deliver an objective and unbiased presentation of the findings, in order to render them and the vendors represented in the virtual mall trustworthy, enhancing thus the customer’s satisfaction from the promise being made.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec12">Navigation</h4><p>The customer can visit a specific store at which a product is available by granting permission to the salesperson agent to transfer him to the store, by clicking on a selected product or by moving to the store himself. In this way, the virtual environment aims to strengthen the customer’s trusting intention while showing the business benevolence that will be assessed to determine the respective customer trusting belief.</p><p>Throughout the duration of the encounter, a customer is free to move in the store and see other products, or visit other stores. The salesperson agent follows the customer closely wherever he goes into the virtual mall being always at the customer’s disposal. Aiming to provide a satisfying enabling of the promise, the agent is exclusively dedicated to the customer and persistently ready to help him, showing the vendor’s ability to meet customer expectations and impelling the customer to behaviorally express his trusting intention. Enabling the promise in this manner positively influences the customer’s trusting belief in the business competence and incites the customer to act in a trusting behavior.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec13">Product and product-related information presentation</h4><p>When a customer arrives at a virtual store, the agent assumes responsibility as the store’s salesperson. The agent welcomes the customer to the store and takes him to the location of the requested product. Products are visually represented within the virtual environment as 3D objects, allowing a customer to view them from all possible angles and fully interact with them. In this way customers are able to preview and experience products before purchase, to ensure satisfaction from the enabling of the promise. Furthermore, the customer is able to see detailed information about a product by clicking on the sign that is next to it, and judge whether or not to depend on the promise.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec14">Order placement, view and purchase</h4><p>A customer can place an order by asking the agent to add a selected product in his shopping cart. To promote the enactment of a trusting behavior, the customer is allowed to delete a product in case he decides not to buy it, while an order is not actually submitted unless the customer specifically asks the agent to do so. In addition, the customer can also ask the agent to show him the content of his shopping cart before purchase.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec15">Order tracking</h4><p>Upon submission of an order, the customer can ask the agent to inform him about the status of the order. The customer can see the products he has ordered, the date the order was submitted, the date it will be delivered and the current status of the order. In this way, the customer is able to check if the promise is being kept as expected, evaluating the vendor’s integrity. In addition, the customer is allowed to cancel or modify an order, as long as the order has not been shipped yet. By keeping the customer constantly up-to-date about the progress of his order delivery and by granting him control of his order, the virtual environment aims to maximize the customer’s satisfaction from the fulfillment of the promise and build his integrity trusting belief. In addition, the satisfaction from the overall interaction that is intended to result from this stage will shape a customer’s trusting belief in predictability.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec16"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec16-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec16">Qualitative study</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec16-content"><p>As mentioned previously, our research objectives were (a) to investigate whether a virtual reality e-commerce environment would be preferred over conventional web stores for online shopping activities or not and to understand the factors leading to the positive or negative evaluation of using a virtual shopping environment instead of a traditional web counterpart and (b) to examine the effectiveness of a virtual reality e-commerce environment for building trust and particularly for shaping customer trusting beliefs in the e-vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability.</p><p>For this purpose, a qualitative study was performed to evaluate the effect of the virtual environment on building trust and gaining customer preference over a typical web-based one. The study was carried out at a University setting with students of a postgraduate Information Systems course. A total of 43 subjects aged between 23 and 34 years participated in the study, 74.4% of them were males. All of them had a computing background, were experienced Internet users and had purchased products online at least once. The participants were asked to interact with the prototype environment, acting as customers of the virtual mall. Data were collected through interviews and participant observation. Using a questionnaire as a guide, the interviews were mostly semi-structured and were conducted in a way that allowed for a focus on the issues under investigation, while permitting the interviewees to expand on areas of personal interest that they thought were important. The purpose of the evaluation was to examine and understand the perceptions created based on the type of functionality provided by a virtual reality e-commerce environment. For this reason, the content of the questions was oriented towards the virtual mall facilities and the way they were offered within it. The questions aimed to extract reactions and perceptions regarding the trustworthiness of a virtual mall and to elicit comments about using such an environment for online shopping in comparison with conventional web stores.</p><p>Two groups of questions were used for data collection (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Tab2">2</a>). The questions were mapped onto the research objectives. The first set of questions intended to collect data about customer preference of a virtual environment compared to a conventional web store. This comprised a general question regarding customer preference of a virtual shopping environment over a conventional web store and eight questions about customer preference for each specific function offered within the virtual environment compared to the one offered in a conventional web store. The second set of questions aimed at collecting data about the effectiveness of the virtual environment for building trust. It comprised four questions about user perceptions of the e-vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability respectively.

                     <p>Data collection and analysis were based on Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1967" title="Glaser B, Strauss A (1967) The discovery of grounded theory: strategies for qualitative research.

Data were analyzed using open coding (Strauss <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1987" title="Strauss AL (1987) Qualitative analysis for social scientists. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#ref-CR38" id="ref-link-section-d52795e1040">1987</a>) as a form of content analysis. Open coding is based on an analytic technique that tends to force the generation of a core category or categories, together with their properties and dimensions. The aim was to establish the core categories using axial coding. This enabled us to generalize the idiographic details revealed by the data interpretation and relate them to general concepts and constructions (Klein and Myers <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Klein HK, Myers MD (1999) A set of principles for conducting and evaluating interpretive field studies in information systems.

Seven respondents (16.2%) were negative towards using a virtual environment for online shopping instead of a typical web store and one respondent (2.3%) was neutral with respect to preferring a virtual to a conventional online shopping environment.</p><p>The comments received were analyzed and interpreted. The emerged interpretations revealed a set of categories explaining why and in what instances customers would trust and show a preference for such a virtual environment over a conventional web store for conducting e-commerce activities. These were categorized as <i>similarity to a real-world shopping context</i>, <i>visualization</i> and <i>interaction</i>.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Similarity to a real-world shopping context</h3><p>Users’ comments evaluating the virtual environment compared to traditional web ones related to the similarity of the virtual mall to a real-world shopping context. The similarity to real-world shopping category uncovered a list of characteristics that were perceived as central to the assessment of the vendor’s trustworthiness in all steps of the interaction. This is in agreement with Fogg et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Fogg BJ, Marshall J, Laraki O, Osipovich A, Varma C, Fang N, Paul J, Rangnekar A, Shon J, Swani P, Treinen M (2001) What makes web sites credible? A report on a large quantitative study. ACM SIGCHI 3(1):61–67" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#ref-CR12" id="ref-link-section-d52795e1068">2001</a>) who found that a real-world feel is the most important factor affecting web site credibility.</p><p>The users’ thought of the E-scape as a metaphor of a realistic shopping environment which strongly reminded them of a physical shopping mall. They had the feeling that they performed shopping activities in the same way they do in real world. They could walk and visit stores, view and touch products, see and talk to other customers and be served by a salesperson that they could actually see and have a dialogue with. A user commented:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“In general, the virtual mall largely approximates the physical shopping, through the existence and communication with the salesperson agent, and I prefer that compared to traditional e-shopping.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>The similarity of the virtual environment to a real-world shopping context allowed for the accommodation of social elements of shopping. The shopping process in real life is a social one (Maamar <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Maamar Z (2003) Commerce, e-commerce, and m-commerce: what comes next? Commun ACM 46(12):251–257" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#ref-CR30" id="ref-link-section-d52795e1079">2003</a>). Apart from conducting pure commercial transactions, the users were able to engage in shopping-related activities that are not available in a typical web store, like browsing, window-shopping, moving around stores, seeing other shoppers, going shopping with others. The virtual environment was appreciated to provide a rich shopping experience which besides being useful was also pleasant. In this way the online shopping process was more realistic and attractive as it was augmented with social characteristics of the physical one. According to one user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“What’s really interesting is that the virtual mall can be good for socializing. You can see other customers shopping and moving around and you can easily go for virtual shopping with company! It’s also easy to see vividly whether there is congestion. For example, you can see that there is a lot of people in a specific store while in another it’s just you and it gets crowded at busy hours.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>These features gave the users from the first moment a sense of familiarity, in the sense that they could easily identify and recognize elements of traditional shopping and associate them with their virtual counterparts. The virtual environment and the interaction enabled within it were perceived to be consistent with their mental model of physical shopping and thus they could easily transfer their accumulated knowledge and experience from the bricks-and-mortar world and apply it to the virtual context. This swiftly gained sense of familiarity resulted in perceiving the virtual environment as straightforward, self-explanatory and easy-to-use. The positive influence of familiarity on perceived ease-of-use has also been found in (Gefen et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Gefen D, Karahanna E, Straub D (2003) rust and TAM in online shopping: an integrated model. MIS Q 27(1):51–90" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d52795e1087">2003</a>). As described by a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“I’d prefer to do shopping in an environment like a virtual mall. The way it works corresponds a great deal to the way real shops work. A buyer feels he is in a much more familiar environment. Common web sites provide the same products; however, they don’t provide this familiarity to the customer; you don’t have the feeling that you are in a store and you are shopping. The virtual mall corresponds a lot to the way someone is doing shopping in real life.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>In this way, the users evaluated the shopping experience in the virtual environment as superior to that in conventional e-commerce sites as they thought that it integrated the advantages of both physical and online shopping. A user commented:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“I’d definitely prefer the virtual mall which combines the advantages of buying online, buying from anywhere anytime and some of the advantages of shopping in the usual way, dialogue with the salesperson, who facilitates the consumer.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>In addition, the association of the environment with the electronic equivalent of a physical shopping place reduced the cognitive effort that would normally be demanded for assessing the trustworthiness of a traditional web vendor, thus precipitating the formation of trust. This is also supported by other works that have found that familiarity has a positive impact on trust either directly (Gefen <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Gefen D (2000) E-commerce: the role of familiarity and trust. Omega 28(6):725–737" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#ref-CR14" id="ref-link-section-d52795e1101">2000</a>) or indirectly through its effect on perceived ease-of-use (Gefen et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Gefen D, Karahanna E, Straub D (2003) rust and TAM in online shopping: an integrated model.

Despite the fact that the virtual environment was significantly different from a typical web store interface, it raised trust perceptions because of the high degree of understandability and ease-of-use perceived by the users.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Visualization</h3><p>The second category that emerged from the analysis of the data related to the high visualization degree in the appearance of the virtual environment. Visualization was offered at all levels of the environment appearance, involving salespersons, customers, products and shops. Users were able to see their virtual self-representation in the form of an avatar, which generated a feeling of physical presence in the environment. In conjunction with the ability to view other customers and salespeople, this made the users reappraise their role from that of a user of a faceless interface to that of an actor in a living, naturalistic environment. They felt that they were active participants in a shopping process carried out in a realistic way, as they could walk and see the virtual shops and products. This also enabled them to have an explicit view and awareness of the environment and facilitated navigation. As one user said:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“It’s simpler and more natural than a conventional web site. You have a 3D perspective of the space, where you can naturally move, just like in a real store.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>The provision of visualized input at all levels was to allow for an environment integrating features of both physical and conventional web stores. This augmented appearance offered a convenient to use environment, which is an important contributor to customer satisfaction from the web shopping experience (Shim et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Shim JP, Shin YB, Nottingham L (2002) Retailer web site influence on customer shopping: an exploratory study on key factors of customer satisfaction.

As described by a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“It’s definitely better than existing e-commerce sites because the presentation of products takes place in a 3D almost natural environment and also because the product itself is a 3D representation of the real one and you can also interact with it. So the customer gets a more clear idea of the product and this contributes to a much better shopping experience and also to a much safer product choice.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Visualization was particularly positively evaluated with respect to the 3D virtual products. Users showed a high preference for a 3D view of products over a 2D one, as they could have a richer experience of the product. This preference was often expressed with a requirement for high-quality images so that virtual products are perfect and precise representations of the real ones. The 3D representation of products satisfies the reported consumer need for better images and adequate visualization of products (Jarvenpaa and Todd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Jarvenpaa SL, Todd PA (1997) Consumer reactions to electronic shopping on the world wide web.

This is illustrated in the following comment:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“It’s definitely more impressive to have a 3D view of a product and to be able to observe it from different perspectives by rotating it and it gives more information about the product than a 2D one in a current e-commerce web site.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>The 3D visualization of products and stores also satisfies the reported consumer need for easy and convenient product comparisons (Jarvenpaa and Todd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Jarvenpaa SL, Todd PA (1997) Consumer reactions to electronic shopping on the world wide web.

                  </div></blockquote><p>In addition, the visual depiction of stores in the form of a mall structure allowed for viewing different stores and navigating to them for comparing products and prices, covering another consumer requirement for seeing “head-to-head competition that you can see in a mall”, not met by conventional web stores (Jarvenpaa and Todd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Jarvenpaa SL, Todd PA (1997) Consumer reactions to electronic shopping on the world wide web.

                    <p>“The structure and the familiar layout of stores, which are not collocated in conventional web sites, are an advantage. And it facilitates you to look for a product, either by teleport or by navigating in the mall stores.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Furthermore, the visualization of salespersons in an anthropomorphic figure created the sense of a face-to-face contact with a real vendor, as the avatar was perceived as the virtual substitute of a human salesperson, thus facilitating the formation of trust (Doney and Cannon <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Doney P, Cannon J (1997) An examination of the nature of trust in buyer–seller relationships.

                        <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Interaction</h3><p>Interaction within the virtual shopping environment and the way this was carried out constitute the final category. Although the functionality offered was largely similar to that provided by traditional web stores, the way this functionality was delivered through interacting within a virtual environment with the expressiveness of a physical commercial context, led the users develop a positive stance towards the environment and also express a strong preference over a conventional web store.</p><p>The primary aspect of the interaction that was deemed as important in making a difference with conventional web stores was the interaction with the virtual salesperson. The dialogue with a virtual salesperson resembled a human communication, offering a sense of an interpersonal relationship with the customer. In this way, the shopping process was friendly and natural, close to the physical one, which made it more pleasant and attractive than that of a conventional web store. As described by a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“It’s much better to talk in almost natural language to a salesperson than having an expressionless and cold search engine which may do the job but doesn’t make shopping feel like fun but rather a boring experience. With the virtual mall process, it’s like the buyer is chatting with the salesperson and that’s the usual shopping process, not completing some kind of form.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>As such the users preferred to perform their shopping activities through having a personal dialogue with a virtual salesperson over interacting with a faceless interface of a usual web store using forms, links and buttons. The users thought that their interaction was facilitated and improved by being served by a personal salesperson doing for them all the tasks they wanted to perform, avoiding problems often encountered in web sites such as ‘hard to follow ordering directions’ (Jarvenpaa and Todd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Jarvenpaa SL, Todd PA (1997) Consumer reactions to electronic shopping on the world wide web.

They could simply turn to the salesperson and ask him to do what they would normally accomplish through a sequence of complicated links. According to a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“I get the impression that I’ll have help at every step I make for searching a product and that I won’t get lost among links. This is very important. On the other hand, though, I have to type and lose time instead of clicking on a link. In conclusion, I’d prefer the virtual mall because it makes me feel more sure that I’ll have immediate help in finding exactly what I want and I won’t need to spend time searching in some web pages.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>On the other hand, there were also negative comments about interacting with the intervention of the virtual salesperson, concerning mostly the functions of order placement and view. They were found to be time consuming as they involved typing instead of clicking. A respondent said:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“The [order placement and order view] procedure seems time-consuming to me, for example I have to type ‘add to cart #18’ or ‘show my cart’ instead of a single click”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>However, the same respondent, regarding purchase, said:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“In this case, although the procedure is more time-consuming, I prefer buying products like in the virtual mall. The reason is that it assures me that I won’t make a purchase by accident, by clicking or pressing ‘enter’ by mistake.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>Performing shopping-related activities through engaging in a dialogue with the salesperson was deemed easier and more effective, especially when searching for a product of interest, as the dialogue would proceed gradually, with successive questions refining the search according to the user criteria to find the item that best suits his needs. This allowed for convenience in goal-directed shopping, a task which 44% of consumers consider to be difficult in web stores (Jarvenpaa and Todd <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Jarvenpaa SL, Todd PA (1997) Consumer reactions to electronic shopping on the world wide web.

As commented by a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“Searching is done in a more realistic way, much like when a customer is physically present in a real store.

With the salesperson constantly providing help and guidance in every step of the shopping process, the users felt safe that they would never get confused or lost during interaction. A user mentioned:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“You have someone [the virtual salesperson] at your disposal throughout the shopping duration. So the customer feels secure that he won’t get confused or lost while shopping.”</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>As such, navigation was found to be very easy and intuitive, as the users could navigate into the environment either independently, simply by walking to a place of interest or by requesting their salesperson to teleport them to a specific store, right in front of a selected product.</p><p>The users enjoyed and appreciated having a personal, devoted salesperson, always at their disposal, which gives them personal attention and shows courtesy by providing constant guidance, offers individualized service, eagerly responds to all their requests and helps in their intended tasks. These created empathy and assurance and responsiveness which have been found to have a trust-building effect (Gefen <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Gefen D (2002) Customer loyalty in e-commerce.

As shown in the following comment:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                    <p>“The role of the salesperson is central to the virtual mall. It provides a sense of personification of responsibility from the vendor side towards the customer. As such, it increases the level of customer trust, to the extent to which he [the customer] thinks that he has an exclusive salesperson that will serve him, help him or reply to any question and will be responsible for the success or failure of the shopping transaction. On the contrary, in traditional web sites, the whole vendor–customer relationship remains impersonal, which makes such web commercial transactions completely different from physical shopping.”</p>

All three stages of promise fulfillment and the entire interaction were found to satisfy the users, with the perceived satisfaction from each of them having a positive trust-building effect, by conveying the e-vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec21">Benevolence</h4><p>The stage of ‘making a promise’, comprising the functions of welcome, recommendations and search, gave the users the sense that the e-vendor was benevolent. Benevolence was conveyed mainly through the virtual salesperson and the way it interacted with the customer for welcome, recommendations and search. The virtual salesperson reminded the users of a real one, who welcomes, recommends products and facilitates their search for a product showing an interest in the customer. The personal dialogue with the virtual salesperson created a sense of friendly, human communication which facilitated the users to assess the vendor’s benevolence. As shown in the following comment:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                      <p>“These functions [welcome, recommendations, search] as they are in the virtual mall give the customer the feeling that the store is benevolent, that it cares about its customers and their best service. This feeling comes from the fact that the communication is more friendly and less distant. From the very first moment the customer has the feeling of having a dialogue with a real salesperson who is dedicated only to him.”</p>
                    </div></blockquote><p>Perceived benevolence was especially due to the welcoming of the customer by a human-like figure, the virtual salesperson, greeting the customer visiting the store and initiating a friendly dialogue with him, like in face-to-face communication one would have in a physical store. With the virtual salesperson giving individualized recommendations, asking questions for preferences and providing guidance around the stores, the users felt that they received attention and that they are considered as important and treated as such. As one of them mentioned:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">

                    </div></blockquote><p>Benevolence was projected with the continuous presence of the virtual salesperson providing constant help. The salesperson was perceived to show an explicit willingness to aid the customers at any time in the shopping process. Users felt the salesperson was always available for them to provide personal service when needed. This created feelings of empathy, assurance and responsiveness, which have been found to influence trust (Gefen <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Gefen D (2002) Customer loyalty in e-commerce.

Friendliness, will to serve and offering help at any time are enough to create such a feeling.”</p>
                    </div></blockquote><p>In addition, the fact that the salesperson was personal and devoted exclusively to the customer was also perceived as a sign of interest about the customer.

In a real store when a salesperson spends his time exclusively on one customer it shows interest and good motives. So in the virtual mall one feels he has someone next to him anytime.”</p>
                    </div></blockquote><p>These characteristics were perceived as cues that the vendor actually cares for the customer and is willing to provide a good quality service. In this way they shaped the users belief that the vendor is benevolent and positively influenced their intention to trust the store and proceed with their activities.

The users made a positive evaluation of the vendor’s integrity simply by the fact that there was an order-tracking facility available to the customer. The information on delivery also conveyed integrity as it created a feeling of confidence regarding the order fulfillment, similar to the reliability service quality dimension which has been indicated to influence trust (Gefen <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Gefen D (2002) Customer loyalty in e-commerce.

                    </div></blockquote><p>In addition, the integrity belief was further enhanced as they felt that with this facility the vendor gave the customer control of the process. Previous research has shown that perceived control in e-commerce has a positive impact on customer attitudes (Cheskin Research and Studio Archetype/Sapient Report <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Cheskin research and studio archetype/sapient report (1999) E-commerce trust study.

                    </div></blockquote><p>Therefore, this interaction stage allowed the users to assess the extent to which the store has actually delivered on its promise, although partially, and judge the e-vendor’s integrity.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec24">Predictability</h4><p>The perceived satisfaction from the overall interaction could also only partially drive the users opinion about the vendor’s predictability.</p><p>With respect to the interface, the users felt that they always knew what happens next throughout their interaction.

                    </div></blockquote><p>This was due to the constant contact with the salesperson and the resemblance to the physical shopping experience. Real-world feel has been ranked as the most important web site element relating to trust (Fogg et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Fogg BJ, Marshall J, Laraki O, Osipovich A, Varma C, Fang N, Paul J, Rangnekar A, Shon J, Swani P, Treinen M (2001) What makes web sites credible?

The metaphor of a realistic environment and the metaphor of a salesperson worked as a catalyst in reducing the complexities inherent in the interaction, as in any human–computer interaction. This is supported by other research works showing that humans respond to computers as if they were social entities (Reeves and Nass <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Reeves B, Nass C (1996) The media equation: how people treat computers, television and new media like real people and places.

The users, based on their mental model of shopping in the bricks-and-mortar world, made associations of the various steps of the interaction with those that they are used to and know from the real world. As such, the interaction was natural to them and it was easy for them to figure out what to expect next, what they would expect in real-life shopping. According to a user:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                      <p>“I think that the interaction provided by the virtual mall through the use of the agent helps the user know at which state he is and what to expect next. That’s because the user generally knows what to expect from a salesperson in real world and so what [he knows] to expect from the agent.”</p>
                    </div></blockquote><p>The overall interaction allowed the users to assess the store’s consistency in delivering the promises it makes, and thus make inferences regarding its predictability. However, the belief in the e-vendor’s predictability would ultimately be completely shaped gradually over time, after gaining experience with e-vendor.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec25"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec25-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec25">Discussion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec25-content"><p>In this section the preference of the virtual shopping environment over a web one as well as its effectiveness in building customer trust are discussed with respect to the number of users positive, neutral and negative responses.

                     <p>According to the results presented in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Tab3">3</a>, the respondents showed a preference for most of the functions as offered in the virtual environment. The users had a clear preference for the product and product information view (93%), welcome (83.7%) and search (58.1%) functions. They were also positive and had a strong preference for the recommendations (48.8%) and purchase (41.8%) functions. The reasons leading to this preference have already been explained in the analysis above.</p><p>Some respondents were neutral in their evaluation of certain functions, especially order tracking (58.1%), order view (46.5%) and recommendations (41.8%). This was because they could not find any difference between the way these are offered in a virtual and a conventional web environment, which would be significant enough for them to develop a preference for the one over the other. Another reason for the respondents being neutral regarding their evaluation and preference of functions was that what was important for them was the specific function to be in place and not the way the function was provided, in a virtual or not environment.</p><p>A small number of respondents were negative towards preferring the functions of a virtual environment to a conventional web one. These respondents stated that they preferred to perform these activities, particularly order placement (48.8%), as in a typical web site, through a number of clicks instead of typing sentences as in the virtual environment, because they are familiar with using existing web sites and they need less time for performing these activities in such sites than in a virtual environment.</p><p>According to the results presented in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-006-0059-x#Tab4">4</a>, the users evaluations show that a virtual reality shopping environment builds customer trust. The users’ responses regarding the effect of the functions of each interaction stage on trusting beliefs confirmed the findings of the empirical tested model. The functions of welcome, recommendations and search, associated with the first interaction stage, build trust in the vendor’s benevolence (86%). The functions of product view, product information view, order placement, order view and purchase, associated with the second interaction stage, build trust in the vendor’s competence (76.7%). The function of order tracking, associated with the third interaction stage, builds trust in the vendor’s integrity (67.4%). Finally, the overall interaction builds trust in the vendor’s predictability (55.8%).</p><p>Some users were neutral in their evaluation of certain functions with respect to their impact on trust. These evaluations were mainly about the effect of order tracking on the integrity belief (30.2%) and the effect of the overall interaction on the predictability belief (32.5%). The users said that these functions were not suffice to fully judge the vendor’s integrity and predictability and that they would need experience over time to completely form such beliefs.</p><p>A small number of users (2.3–11.6%) were negative regarding the effect of the virtual environment functions in shaping trusting beliefs in the vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability. These users said that these beliefs can only be formed through repeated interaction and not through the functionality provided within the virtual environment.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26">Implications</h3><p>The findings emanating from our study of the virtual reality e-commerce environment illustrate that (a) virtual reality e-commerce environments can be superior to and preferred over conventional web sites for online shopping, and (b) virtual reality e-commerce environments can promote trust building, especially the formation of customer trusting beliefs in the benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability of the online vendor. Several implications for theory and practice arise. These are summarized in the following paragraphs.</p><p>A virtual environment serves as a metaphor of a bricks-and-mortar store, creating an illusionary sense of a realistic commercial context, consistent with the customer mental model of a physical shopping experience. In this way a customer can draw a parallel with the experience held from the interaction in physical settings and apply it while interacting within the virtual environment. As a result, a virtual shopping environment raises perceptions of being familiar, simple, understandable, convenient and easy-to-use, and to a higher degree than a web-based one. In this way it can be more appealing to use and gain customer preference over a conventional online store. At the same time, it facilitates customer judgments about the trustworthiness of the vendor. This is in agreement with Fogg et al.

The association of the environment with the electronic equivalent of a physical shopping place reduces the cognitive effort that would normally be demanded for assessing the trustworthiness of a traditional web vendor, thus precipitating the formation of trust. This is also supported by other works that have found that familiarity has a positive impact on trust either directly (Gefen <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Gefen D (2000) E-commerce: the role of familiarity and trust.

This allows for an augmented interaction, compared to that in conventional online store, which is also more pleasant, convenient and attractive. It enables a full view of products in 3D and facilitates navigation, product comparisons or even head-to-head competition in a virtual mall setting. As such visualization also results in a trust-engendering environment; a finding that is consistent with a number of other studies that have found that trust is influenced by perceived site quality (McKnight et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="McKnight DH, Choudhury V, Kacmar C (2002) The impact of initial consumer trust on intentions to transact with a web site: a trust building model.

Instead of completing forms, clicking on links and viewing messages, for shopping activities, as in web-based stores, in a virtual environment the customer can engage in a personal dialog with a virtual salesperson, through, for example, a chat-style facility using natural-type language. As such, the faceless interaction with the usual web interface is advanced to a human-like communication, where the customer talks and has a virtual eye contact with the salesperson. In addition, a virtual salesperson can promote customer trust as it facilitates the projection and assessment of a vendor’s benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability. This is in line with the findings of (Urban et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Urban GL, Sultan F, Qualls WJ (2000) Placing trust at the center of your internet strategy.

Thus, this study confirms previous works (Lee and Chung <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Lee KC, Chung N (2005) A Web DSS approach to building an intelligent internet shopping mall by integrating virtual reality and avatar.

Further research is needed to fully explore the possibilities of these two technologies for e-commerce environments as well as the adoption and use of such environments in practice.</p><p>The study showed that a virtual reality shopping environment can deliver the functionality of a typical e-store with the expressiveness of a physical, face-to-face interaction. In this way, a virtual reality e-commerce environment offers a shopping experience that is preferred over conventional web stores and enables the projection and assessment of an e-vendor’s trustworthiness.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, this is attributed to the perceived satisfaction resulting from the interaction stages with welcome, recommendations, search, product and product-related information view, order placement, purchase and order-tracking functions. Such functions are currently typical of conventional online stores, such as Amazon.com, provided through a web interface with forms, links and text messages. However, the same functions, when provided within a virtual reality shopping environment, can be preferred by customers and can also build a customer’s trust in the e-vendor’s benevolence competence, integrity and predictability.</p><p>Our findings show that virtual reality can be successfully applied for e-commerce environments and the functions associated with shopping activities, especially for welcome, recommendations, search, product presentation, product information and purchase functions. In specific, virtual reality, and particularly the use of a virtual salesperson, is suitable for welcome and search functions. In addition, virtual reality should be applied for product presentation. The 3D representation of products allows for a rich product experience and a complete view and examination of the product, which is missing from conventional online stores. A prerequisite for this is that the virtual representation of the product is of high quality. Furthermore, recommendations, purchase and order-tracking functions can also be provided through a virtual salesperson. On the other hand, the use of virtual reality and specifically the use of a virtual salesperson should be adopted with caution for order placement and order view. Possible alternative ways in which such functions should be provided within a virtual reality environment, either with or without the intervention of a virtual salesperson is an issue that requires further research. These functions could possibly not be provided through a dialogue with a virtual salesperson. This implies that these functions should be made available in a different way, either without involving a dialogue with a virtual salesperson or by enabling a communication with the virtual salesperson by different means than typing text or by providing a hybrid interaction combining communication with the virtual salesperson in combination with other means of interaction. In any case, the interaction with the functions through a virtual salesperson should be easy-to-use, simple and fast, without demanding much typing or other time-consuming actions by the customers.</p><p>The study shows that functions in a virtual reality e-commerce environment build trusting beliefs in the online vendor. Welcome recommendations and search build benevolence. Product and product information view, order placement, order view and purchase build competence. Order tracking builds integrity. The overall interaction builds predictability. However, customer beliefs, particularly in the integrity and predictability of the vendor, are partially formed through the interaction within the virtual environment. The assessment of these attributes is completed over time, after repeated interactions and depending on customer satisfaction from the actual order delivery as well as from after sales services. These findings confirm those from the empirical testing of the model regarding the influence of these functions on trust. A question that emerges and needs further research is whether a virtual reality e-commerce environment is more effective in building customer trust than a conventional web one. A comparative study is needed of the trust-building effectiveness of these functions between a virtual reality shopping environment and a conventional web one. This will enhance our understanding regarding the effectiveness of virtual reality shopping environments for building customer trust. In addition, it will provide further insights regarding the suitability of applying virtual reality in e-commerce.</p><p>Virtual reality shopping environments can be more attractive and suitable for novice, inexperienced users, who are often daunted by web sites. However, this might not hold for experienced users, as shopping in such an environment can be deemed as time-consuming or boring, largely because of their familiarity with existing sites.</p><p>Besides the functionality related to conducting commercial transactions, a virtual environment allows for the development of customer communities, as customers can view others and communicate with, for example using a chat facility. The evaluation study presented was focused on customer interaction within the virtual mall in terms of pure shopping activities. However, it was possible to understand from the analysis and interpretation of the participants’ comments that a virtual reality e-commerce environment provides a pleasant and rich shopping experience, which includes social elements of a physical one. Customers, apart from conducting pure commercial transactions, can engage in shopping-related activities of social nature, that are not available in a typical web store, such as browsing, window-shopping, moving around stores, seeing other shoppers, going shopping with others or socializing. Further research should include the evaluation of the interaction among customers within the virtual environment. Such a study would enhance our understanding on social dimensions of virtual reality shopping environments. In addition it would advance the evaluation of the effectiveness of a virtual environment for building trust and of the preference of such environments over conventional shopping sites.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec27"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec27-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec27">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec27-content"><p>Virtual reality emerges as a promising technology for a new breed of e-commerce applications that can address the critical need for integrating both technical and social aspects of online shopping. However, the research agenda on virtual reality applications for e-commerce is technology-focused and should be expanded to incorporate social and behavioral issues.</p><p>In this direction, this paper contributes by providing an empirical assessment of the potential of virtual reality shopping environments for building customer trust and gaining preference over web commerce sites. A prototype virtual e-commerce environment designed on trust-building principles was presented and evaluated with a qualitative study. The participants were experienced Internet users with a computing background. Such a profile might suggest bias in the results of the assessment, both positive, as it was easier for such users to use the virtual environment, as well as negative, as they were more demanding from average users. The study showed that a virtual reality shopping environment can deliver the functionality of a typical e-store with the expressiveness of a physical, face-to-face interaction thus allowing for a superior and trust-building online shopping experience. The analysis and interpretation of the results provided further insights as to how and why virtual reality environments for e-commerce can enable the building of customer trust and can be preferred over conventional web stores for online shopping.</p></div></div></section>
