    <meta name="dc.description" content="To assess and improve the user experience in entertainment products, developers need results of evaluation methods, which in detail measure the relationship between the mediated content and the resulting media experience. This paper proposes a method applying adjustable distraction (AD) to determine presence as immersion (Lombard and Ditton in At the heart of it all: the concept of presence, Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University, 1997) at selectable events (approximated real-time). Two experiments were conducted to investigate its applicability in computer games and movies with respectively visual and tactile AD. The first experiment examined whether the experienced intensity in a survival-shooter game, measured through questionnaires, was proportional to results from the AD method. The intrusiveness of the AD method was also addressed in the experiment by comparing the immersive presence ratings in a between-groups design. The second experiment investigated whether heart rate measurements, intensity ratings and the results of the AD method with vibration as the distraction signal were proportional when test participants watched a movie clip. The outcome of the first experiment indicated that no significant intrusion is caused by the method. In addition, results showed no proportionality between the AD method and intensity ratings. However, as the AD measurements were supported by flow theory, it might be that the results from the AD method using visual distraction are giving a more comprehensive indication of presence as immersion (rather than just the intensity dimension). The second experiment revealed proportionality between the intensity ratings and the heart rate measurements, while the results from the tactile AD method were not proportional. We suspect that this was caused by the great variance found across the test participants&#8217; thresholds of perceivable vibration. Because of this, it is suggested that a thorough screening process is conducted pre-test if the AD method should apply vibration as the distracting stimulus."/>

This paper proposes a method applying adjustable distraction (AD) to determine presence as immersion (Lombard and Ditton in At the heart of it all: the concept of presence, Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Lombard M, Ditton T (1997) At the heart of it all: the concept of presence. Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR26" id="ref-link-section-d15782e272">1997</a>) at selectable events (approximated real-time). Two experiments were conducted to investigate its applicability in computer games and movies with respectively visual and tactile AD. The first experiment examined whether the experienced intensity in a survival-shooter game, measured through questionnaires, was proportional to results from the AD method. The intrusiveness of the AD method was also addressed in the experiment by comparing the immersive presence ratings in a between-groups design. The second experiment investigated whether heart rate measurements, intensity ratings and the results of the AD method with vibration as the distraction signal were proportional when test participants watched a movie clip. The outcome of the first experiment indicated that no significant intrusion is caused by the method. In addition, results showed no proportionality between the AD method and intensity ratings. However, as the AD measurements were supported by flow theory, it might be that the results from the AD method using visual distraction are giving a more comprehensive indication of presence as immersion (rather than just the intensity dimension). The second experiment revealed proportionality between the intensity ratings and the heart rate measurements, while the results from the tactile AD method were not proportional. We suspect that this was caused by the great variance found across the test participants’ thresholds of perceivable vibration. Because of this, it is suggested that a thorough screening process is conducted pre-test if the AD method should apply vibration as the distracting stimulus.</p></div></div></section>

This entails that the development of this type of games or movies is of high financial risk. Applying content-related evaluation methods to determine whether a media product translates into a positive user experience might aid the developers in making correct decisions on the road to creating a well-selling product.

This is especially due to the belief that being present in an environment makes a person able to respond emotionally to events and characters contained within the mediated experience (Tan <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Tan E (1995) Film-induced affect as a witness emotion.

It can therefore be hard to measure and document (Baren and Ijsselsteijn <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Baren J, Ijsselsteijn W (2004) Measuring presence: a guide to current measurement approaches.

To overcome this problem, presence measurement methods have emerged, which apply different approaches in providing an indication of the amount of presence experienced. This paper attempts to adapt some of these existing presence measuring methods to give developers of entertainment products a tool to handle the intangibility of evaluating a mediated experience.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec2">Limitations of using questionnaires in the development process</h3><p>The common way of measuring presence is through post-test questionnaires (Baren and Ijsselsteijn <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Baren J, Ijsselsteijn W (2004) Measuring presence: a guide to current measurement approaches.

Analysis of the data derived from such questionnaires is generally used to determine presence as a product of the <i>entire</i> mediated experience. Fragments such as a clever scene transition, an unlocked game reward or a risky verbal line from a character, will therefore not be evaluated separately but as a part of the whole experience. Having a questionnaire returning a general presence indication as a result of a test session will not aid the game and film makers, as this indication does not give any hints as to what fragments worked as intended, and which should be improved during development. To examine fragments with questionnaires, the experiment could be divided into smaller sub-experiments meant only to focus on a single fragment. However, that would take a significant amount of time for each interesting fragment and it would not provide developers with information on how preceding parts of the entire experience impact on the experience of the fragment.</p><p>The ideal case, with respect to evaluation of fragments, would instead be a method which is capable of measuring presence real-time during the experiment. The results of the method could thereby be depicted as a continuous time/presence relationship curve (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig1">1</a>). This could enable developers to relate minimum and maximum readings on the curve with elements encountered in the test session at the particular time of the measurement. Through such a curve the developers would also be able to distinguish different levels of presence, which thereby would make it possible to track improvements in later tests by comparing the level of presence at the time where a certain part of the experience occurs.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig1_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-1-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig1_HTML.gif" alt="figure1" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-1-desc"><p>The outcome of an ideal measuring method—example of a continuous presence <i>curve</i>

                        <p>Even though questionnaires are widely used in presence evaluation, we do not in general think they are designed for performing continuous measurements, due to the limitations of human memory. However, questionnaires might be used to approximate these measurements, but then they would have to contain questions regarding specific events or features in the movie, game or VR experience, which the developers consider to be important (e.g., unique selling points). As the participants have to evaluate retrospectively (post-test), these features or events have to be somehow memorable in order for the participants to remember the particular instance and how the experience was during that event.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Seeking inspiration in existing approximated continuous measuring methods</h3><p>Several alternative presence measurement methods already exist. Even though not all of them produce moment-to-moment results displayed like a continuous curve (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig1">1</a>), they all seek to measure and log presence at points during mediation of the test material. One of them is the use of <i>psycho-physiological</i> measurements (measures of heartbeat, muscular responses, etc., as an indicator of presence). Applying physical reactions of the body as a measure of presence is justified by the theory that if one is present in a virtual environment, the body of the person will react to stimuli in the virtual environment in the same way as it would in the real world (Baren and Ijsselsteijn <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Baren J, Ijsselsteijn W (2004) Measuring presence: a guide to current measurement approaches.

Examples of these responses are increase/decrease in heart rate (Jang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Jang D et al (2002) Analysis of physiological response to two virtual environments: driving and flying simulation.

A disadvantage of this type of measurement is generally that the equipment can pick up low signal-to-noise ratios. For instance, it has been seen that movements (electric activity) in the muscles around the head region (such as speaking or chewing) can corrupt recordings of ongoing EEG measurements (Schlögl et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Schlögl A et al (2002) Presence research and EEG.

Besides that, it is known that heart rate and skin conductivity correlate with emotions such as anxiety (Jang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Jang D et al (2002) Analysis of physiological response to two virtual environments: driving and flying simulation. Cyberpsychol Behav 5(1):11–18" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR7" id="ref-link-section-d15782e435">2002</a>), which would normally only makes these measurements relevant to certain movie and game genres that seek to evoke and play on such emotional states.</p><p>Another suggested way of measuring presence is through <i>behavioral measurements</i>, namely observations of a person’s behavior while being exposed to the test material. As with psycho-physical studies, these measurements rely on the idea that if a person feels present in an environment, the person will behave in the same manner in the virtual environment as in the real world, for instance by leaning in the counter-direction of a mediated movement (Freeman et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Freeman J et al (2000) Using behavioral realism to estimate presence: a study of the utility of postural responses to motion stimuli. Presence 9(2):149–164" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d15782e444">2000</a>). A benefit of behavioral measurements is that behavior is often triggered spontaneously, without the test person having much control of it. However, a significant downside of this method is that the observer can misinterpret the behavior and that the test has to be specifically designed to a situation where a behavioral response can be provoked from the test persons, which is not necessarily the case for any feature or narrative in the environment which developers want to evaluate. Finally, it would probably require several observers to perform this kind of measurement, adding expenses to the overall budget.</p><p>The usage of <i>breaks in presence</i> (Slater and Steed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Slater M, Steed A (2000) A virtual presence counter. Presence Teleoper Virtual Environ 9(5):413–434" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR32" id="ref-link-section-d15782e453">2000</a>) also seems interesting as it can provide hints regarding what elements, in a mediated environment, are likely to induce breaks in presence during a test session (Steed et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Steed A et al (2005) Breaks in presence as usability criteria. Proceedings of HCI international 2005" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR11" id="ref-link-section-d15782e456">2005</a>). This way of measuring entails that the participant reports every time his or her attention is brought back to reality after the participant has been feeling present in the presented material. The method relies on the test participants’ ability to judge whenever their attention has returned from feeling presence. A drawback of this method is that it is not sensitive to different levels of presence, and it does not take into account that a person can be partially focused on both the mediated and the real environment. Another issue is that it requires careful instruction of the test participants beforehand in order for them to be able to report when ever the feeling of presence is broken.</p><p>Besides breaks in presence other <i>attention-based</i> measuring methods have emerged in an attempt to measure presence continuously throughout an experiment. One variation is the introduction of a secondary task while having the participant performing in a VR experience. Darken et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Darken R et al (1999) Quantitative measures of presence in virtual environments: the roles of attention and spatial comprehension. Cyberpsychol Behav 2(4):337–347" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d15782e465">1990</a>) exposed test participants to a monitor displaying a movie with a detailed narrative, while the participant at the same time attended a VR experience. The assumption behind this method is that the amount of presence felt in a space corresponds to the amount of attention directed toward the mediated environment. By having the participants recalling events, which had occurred in either the movie or the VR experience, the attention directed toward each environment during the experiment could be measured. Thereby it could be determined at which times the participant had been more present in respectively the VR environment or the movie. Like breaks in presence, this method lets the developers know whether the participant has felt presence in their media product or not. However, with this method, it is still not possible to say at which level the participant has been feeling presence. Another point is that the questioning still takes place post-test (like questionnaires), and therefore the results still rely on the participants’ ability to recall information.</p><p>A third attention-based method is the use of reaction time to a secondary task as a measure for presence (Baren and Ijsselsteijn <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Baren J, Ijsselsteijn W (2004) Measuring presence: a guide to current measurement approaches. Available via: &#xA;                    http://www.informatik.umu.se/~jwworth/PresenceMeasurement.pdf&#xA;                    &#xA;                  . Accessed 30 Jan 2009" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR12" id="ref-link-section-d15782e472">2004</a>, p. 57). In a typical secondary-task reaction time (STRT) experiment, a test subject performs a task (e.g., plays a video game), and at some point, a signal (e.g., a tone) is used to alert the test subject (hence breaks presence). The time difference is then noted from when the signal was emitted to the time where the test subject responded. This time difference is then considered to be a measure of presence (Ijsselsteijn et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Ijsselsteijn W et al (2000) Presence: concept, determinants and measurement.

The underlying assumption behind the STRT method is that as presence increases, more attention (and therefore more mental processing capacity) will be put in the performed task. If more capacity is put into performing the primary task, fewer resources remain for the secondary task (if a limited capacity is assumed), which, in the case of reacting on the signal, could result in a longer reaction time (Ijsselsteijn et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Ijsselsteijn W et al (2000) Presence: concept, determinants and measurement.

Experiments conducted with the purpose of testing the STRT method as an indication of presence have generally returned mixed results (Reeves et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1992" title="Reeves B et al (1992) Faces on the screen: pictures or natural experience?

However, the method is interesting and a valuable contribution within the field of presence evaluation methods.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">The adjustable distraction method</h3><p>We think that an adaptation of one or more of these approaches might remove some of the weaknesses and add a valuable tool to the diversity of evaluation methods for entertainment media. The basic idea behind an adapted method is very well illustrated by the following example:</p><p>Imagine a conversation taking place between a man and a woman sitting on a couch. The television is running in the background. Suddenly, the man catches something interesting on the television and redirects his attention from the conversation to the television. So he becomes more present in the world the television is offering and less present in the real world. When the woman realizes that he is not paying attention to the conversation, she tries to win back his attention. She does not feel like standing up and walking over to turn the television off; instead she attempts to say his name or make a rapid gesture in the hope of catching his attention. If this does not work, she might try to poke him or block his view to the television. Eventually, if none of the prior attempts worked, she would need to turn off the television, which without question will bring back his attention.</p><p>The point of the prior example is to demonstrate the assumption of the purposed method, namely the paradigm that <i>presence is as strong as the minimum amount of stimuli required to break it</i>. The woman in the example is obviously putting more and more effort into getting in contact with the man, and thereby she is increasing the amount of stimuli from reality directed toward him. It is then assumed, that if he is deeply present in a mediated experience it will require a stronger distraction to make him respond than if he only felt a superficial level of presence.</p><p>While thinking of the previous example the conceptualization of <i>presence as immersion</i> coined in “At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence” (Lombard and Ditton <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Lombard M, Ditton T (1997) At the heart of it all: the concept of presence. Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media, Temple University" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR26" id="ref-link-section-d15782e537">1997</a>) seemed to cover the concept well in this case. Presence as immersion is here described as “the degree to which a virtual environment submerges the perceptual system of the user” as well as “the degree to which inputs from the physical environment are shut out” and the extent to which the users feel “involved, absorbed, engaged, engrossed.” Every one of these quotes is very descriptive about the situation of the man and his state of mind in the conversation–television example.</p><p>To form this idea into a concrete method, we took a starting point in the previously described attention-based secondary-task method (Darken et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Darken R et al (1999) Quantitative measures of presence in virtual environments: the roles of attention and spatial comprehension. Cyberpsychol Behav 2(4):337–347" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d15782e544">1990</a>). A number of test participants are here given a simple secondary task to perform, namely to react whenever they are exposed to a primitive stimulus. A “primitive” stimulus is not meant to be another mediated virtual experience such as it is the case in the secondary-task method. Instead, the stimulus should be regarded as a distraction, as in the STRT method, which immediately reminds the participant about the fact that he or she in reality is participating in an experiment and has to respond now. The stimulus used could be any perceivable signal (e.g., a visual, an audible or even a tactile signal). The important factor is that the signal can vary in strength, from undetectable to unavoidable. We have chosen to name the proposed method the adjustable distraction method (henceforth referred to as the AD method).</p><p>This method can be applied to most features or events in media products which might be a subject for evaluation. Improvements can also be tracked by applying the method to each iteration that the product goes through. The method also avoids any subjectivity issues, which for instance are found in cases where behavioral signs are misinterpreted by the observer. The AD method is comparable to breaks in presence as the participants are told to indicate (react) whenever presence is broken. However, in contrast to the breaks in presence method, the participants do not need a careful explanation of the presence concept in order to respond. The proposed method also has great resemblance to the STRT method in the sense that they are both measuring sustained attention. As such, the STRT method has all the advantages of the AD method (e.g., temporal measures, objective, sensitive to different levels, not retrospective). However, the AD method does not rely on time as a measure (but on the amount of distraction) and therefore all factors potentially leading to either increased or decreased reaction times (e.g., age, gender and recent muscular activity) can be disregarded in connection with the use of the AD method.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec5">A mechanism for presenting adjusted stimulus</h4><p>To make the AD method able to track levels of immersive presence, a mechanism for adjusting the strength of the distraction was needed. It has to be independent of time (e.g., the distraction should not gradually increase over time) as making it dependent of time would make all the time-related factors of the STRT a part of the AD method as well. We therefore propose the idea to adjust the strength of the distraction across test participants and thereby obtain a general indication instead of an indication from each individual. The algorithm works as the following.</p><p>A maximum (and minimum) strength of the distraction is given to the algorithm (e.g., strength 0 to strength 10). Half of this value should then be set as the initial distraction strength (e.g., strength 5) for every event, which is to be tested. Now an odd number (<i>n</i>) of test persons should play the game and when an event occurs, a distraction signal of the initial strength should be triggered with the participant either reacting (e.g., pressing a button) or not. The gathered “reacted-or-not” results would then be evaluated, for each individual event, by the computer. If the majority (over 50%) reacted upon the distraction signal of the initial strength, the distraction should decrease, for the next test round with half of the amount from the current strength to the minimum strength (e.g., strength 5 → strength 2.5). Likewise, if the majority did not react upon the distraction, the strength would increase with half of the amount from the current strength to the maximum strength (e.g., strength 5 → strength 7.5). After the evaluation of the first test round, a new distraction strength for every event will be computed and a new round of <i>n</i> test persons can start playing the game with the appearance of the adapted distraction strengths. By always adjusting the distraction strength with either the upper or the lower half of the remaining range of untested strengths, eventually one strength will be left when enough test rounds have been evaluated. This distraction strength is assumed equal to the general amount of cognitive load (or maybe immersive presence) experienced at the particular event. The accuracy of this measure will improve as <i>n</i> tends toward infinity.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec6">The intrusiveness of the method</h4><p>In prior research, it has always been of great interest to keep participants in a stage of presence throughout an experiment, due to the risk of polluting the results through intrusion. Therefore, it might seem unwise to deliberately attempt to break it. However, it makes sense to break presence in order to measure it, when thinking of the analogy, that one has to disassemble something (which in some cases entails destroying it) to know how it is built. The intrusive effect of the method is of course of great concern, and therefore it must be a subject for testing, but we have not found any examples of why returning to the same stage of presence after a break, should not be any different than when, for example, a person is awoken by an alarm clock and then turn around and continue dreaming as nothing happened.</p><p>Optimally, each participant should only experience a single distraction which is strong enough to cause a break in presence. However, it would be interesting to test how intrusive additional breaks (repeated measures) would be, as more stimuli thresholds would make the method able to track how the feeling of presence evolves in the participants during the course of the test material, hence it would thereby approximate the output of an ideal measuring method.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec7"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec7-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec7">Experiments overview</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"><p>All of the considerations from the prior paragraphs can be lined up into one general hypothesis:</p><ul class="u-list-style-none">

                     <p>This hypothesis cannot be accepted based on a single experiment. However, a single experiment can indeed reject it. We therefore wish to initiate a series of experiments from which it is either possible to reject the hypothesis. If the experiments then show a supportive result it will contribute to the likelihood for the hypothesis to be true.</p><p>The remaining sections of this paper will describe the design, execution and implications of the first two of these experiments. Each of the two experiments will test the general hypothesis, but with an emphasis on different aspects which could be a potential problem in the execution of the AD method.

                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H1<sub>A</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>A player’s experience of intensity while playing a game is influenced to a degree which is proportional to the complexity of the presented challenge.</p>
                
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H1<sub>B</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>A player’s experience of intensity while playing a game is proportional to the minimum amount of visual distraction needed to attract the player’s attention.</p>
                <p>This last hypothesis is motivated by the fact that both the amount of mental processing and the degree of experienced intensity can act as indicators of presence as immersion.</p>
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H1<sub>C</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>AD method measurements can be performed several times during a media experience without being significantly intrusive in relation to a participant’s original experience of presence as immersion.</p>
                <p>During the preparations for the experiment, we made a simplification in order to be able to measure presence as immersion at specific events (explained in a later paragraph). Due to this, simplification presence as immersion is described in the hypotheses as the degree of “intensity.” A confirmation of H1<sub>B</sub> would strengthen the idea that the AD method measures at least some part of presence as immersion. Examining H1<sub>C</sub> will inform about the level of “noise” which can be expected when applying the method. H1<sub>A</sub> is the basis of how we expect the level of presence to be during a computer game.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Experimental design</h3><p>To study the intrusiveness (H1<sub>C</sub>) of the AD method, a between-groups design with two experimental conditions was used. The independent variable was the AD method, which was applied on one of the playing groups, while the other group played without it. The depended variable was the extent to which the participants felt presence as immersion. By comparing intensity ratings given by both groups in post-test questionnaires, an insignificant variance in the means was expected in order for the AD method not to be intrusive.</p><p>The above-mentioned experimental design was also able to test H1<sub>B</sub>. As part of the study, a section of the post-test questionnaire was designed to measure intensity at three events retrospectively. Then by comparing the results from the AD method (taken at the same three events) with ratings of intensity from the questionnaires, it could be concluded whether the results correlated or not. Normally, an experimental design will benefit from the use of a statistical model, but in the case of H1<sub>B</sub>, it was not appropriate as the experiment encompassed two very distinct measurement methods, from which the results will be of different scales. Scaling the results to be within the same span was not considered an option, as the minimum and maximum values feed to the algorithm controlling the adjusted distractions are estimates given by the experimenter. Instead, the comparison was based upon the relationship between the mean values of the results collected for each event.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Test material</h3><p>A rough game prototype, centered on a first-person shooter survival gameplay, was created for the purpose of this test. The prototype was meant to represent some of the early drafts and stages that a game developed through a rapid prototyping methodology goes through. This entails that the game contained all the basic gameplay elements but in a crude an unpolished state. Settled in a virtual house the player was here given the main task to survive for 5 min while fighting off an increasing number of enemies (in this case zombies).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Data collection</h3><p>Besides the AD method, post-test paper and pencil questionnaires were used for data collection.</p><p>The part of the questionnaires examining H1<sub>C</sub> were developed according to the measurement guidelines provided by the international society for presence research (ISPR <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="ISPR (2000) International society for presence research.

As it was assessed that it would be too overwhelming and monotonous for the test participants to answer the same three event-questions with different ISPR-terms (e.g., using seven terms to cover presence would result in 3 × 7 = 21 similar questions), it was decided to focus on a single descriptive word for the questions. The three events to be rated were selected based on the game prototype. The game was largely about stressing the player by exposing him or her to lots of attacking enemies. A set of situations that could arise in connection with this could be to name a few, events with many enemies near the player combined with little ammunition, which were assumed to create a more <i>intense</i> experience than events with just many enemies (because of the limited means available to deal with the enemies). As a result, the formulations were as follows:</p><ol class="u-list-style-none">

                        <p>Each of these questions also applied Likert scales with seven rating levels which enabled the participants to grade each case. It was expected that the level of intensity experienced would be descending from event 1 to 3. For example, moments with low ammunition and many enemies nearby was assumed to be more intense (and maybe more immersive) than moments with few zombies and lots of ammunition.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13">Implementation of a visual adjustable distraction</h3><p>The three events to trigger the distraction were specified in the game code through “if” conditions. The amount of zombies encountered by the player was here simplified as the amount of zombies in the same room as the player. Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab1">1</a> lists the conditions that should be fulfilled in the game before an event was registered as occurring.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Displaying the set of conditions describing when the three events will appear</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3/tables/1"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                        <p>The assumption was that the player during a play session would treat the area around the center of the screen as the main point of visual attention, while the outermost areas of the screen would stay in the periphery of sight. As described in Lombard and Ditton (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Lombard M, Ditton T (1997) At the heart of it all: the concept of presence.

If the distracting stimulus was then presented in the outermost areas one should be able to tell when a break in presence occurs. Placing a black border (a neutral zone) around the game visuals makes up an edge, which separates the screen into two regions (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig2">2</a>). The gradually changing visual stimulus was made by altering the size of a gray circle, appearing within the black border on the screen. The larger the circle, the stronger the distraction was assumed to be. The appearance of the circle or dot of a certain size should then either go unnoticed or work as a distraction and break the sense of presence and make the participant react by pressing the right button on the mouse. To hinder that the player would start to anticipate, the dot at a specific location random placement of the dot somewhere within the neutral zone was used.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig2" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 2</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3/figures/2" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig2_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-2-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="figure2" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-2-desc"><p>Screenshot of the game prototype where the screen area is separated into two regions.

                        <p>The maximum diameter of the dot was set to the width of the black border such that the dot size could vary from 0 to 128 pixels. Then, whenever an event would occur, the participant was exposed to a distracting stimulus of certain strength within this span. The participant was then given 2-s to press the button before the stimulus would disappear and the event was marked as “not perceived.”</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Equipment</h3><p>The setup consisted of a computer capable of running the game prototype with and without the implementation of the binary search algorithm. A 15.4″ monitor (running the game full screen in a 1,024 × 768 resolution) was connected to the computer as well as mouse and keyboard for the participants to interact with the game and respond to the distracting stimulus.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15">Procedure</h3><p>The test was conducted in the facilities of Medialogy, Aalborg University Copenhagen. A total of 66 people, between ages 20–30 years, participated and all were full-time students. All participants played first-person shooters on a daily basis and were experienced, and none of them disliked violence in games. Thirty-three participants were assigned to test the game using the AD measuring method (AD group), while the other 33 participants would test the game while no measurements were taken (control group). It was in general very difficult to find female participants who fulfilled the criteria for participation in the experiment (especially fulfilling the criteria of being experienced in playing first-person shooter games). Only four women could be recruited for each group, making the male participants the decisive gender. As the experiment was initiated to give an initial impression of the usefulness of the AD method (and not as a study in gender related issues), the fact that both groups had the same gender ratio was considered to be sufficient.</p><p>Before playing the game, all participants were told about the objectives in the game and what the controls were. The distraction group was given additional instructions to press a mouse button when the dot would appear. Participants of the distraction group played the game at intervals of five persons per test round (<i>n</i> = 5). After the play sessions, all participants were asked to fill out the questionnaire.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec16">Results</h3><p>The means and the standard deviations of the over-all presence questions is displayed in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab2">2</a> for each group.

                        <p>Assuming the adapted method is valid as a measurement of immersive presence, the size of the dot should correspond to the general strength of distraction needed to break a player’s concentration during the given event. “Times evaluated” differs between events because some events occurred less often than others. As a limited amount of test participants were at disposal, the binary search algorithm did not manage to reach a single dot size value for all of the events. Therefore, another parameter must be listed with the results. “Pixel uncertainty” refers to the maximum amount of pixels (px), which the dot size can vary at the arrived point in the search algorithm. The last column “Visual relationship” gives a visual indication of the relationship in size between measurements of each event.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Discussion of the visual distraction test</h3><p>The <i>t</i>-test scores from the seven presence as immersion questions show a relatively low <i>p</i> value related to the degree of fun and the degree to which the tasks were enjoyable. This could be an effect of the AD method. However, none of the group means are significantly different from each other (and the difference in means could therefore also be an outcome of the standard error). This result supports H1<sub>C</sub> and suggests that the AD method was not as intrusive as it was feared to be.</p><p>Results from the event-questions in the questionnaire (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab3">3</a>) show that the participants from both groups ranked the events as expected (H1<sub>A</sub>). However, the results from the AD method (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab4">4</a>) show a different pattern. Event 1 was expected (H1<sub>B</sub>) to have the highest value, but is here assigned the lowest. At a first glance, these results might seem very irrational. However, after some considerations it appears that the results could in fact be supported by the thoughts of the challenge/skills relationship in flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Csikszentmihalyi M (1990) Flow: the psychology of optimal experience. Harper Perennial, New York" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d15782e1605">1990</a>). According to this theory, challenges encountered while performing an activity should be balanced in relation to the player’s skills if the experience is to generate a feeling of flow (a state of mind with features similar to those of presence as immersion). Considering the three chosen events as three challenges of distinct difficulty, it makes sense that event 2 (medium ammo/moderate zombies) required the strongest distraction for players to respond. If games are either too easy (e.g., high ammo/few zombies) or too hard (e.g., low ammo/many zombies), they can become either boring or overwhelming, which might lead the player to direct his or her attention somewhere else. Since presence as immersion has some similarity with flow, for instance, flow can only occur while a person is feeling a deep effortless involvement that removes the awareness of thoughts and other stimuli presented by real life (Csikszentmihalyi <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1990" title="Csikszentmihalyi M (1990) Flow: the psychology of optimal experience. Harper Perennial, New York" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR17" id="ref-link-section-d15782e1609">1990</a>, p. 49), the results from the AD method might in this case be giving a more “complete” indication of presence as immersion at the specific events rather than just the single intensity dimension addressed by the questionnaires. It also can be questioned whether the answers to the event-questions (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab3">3</a>) actually are the outcome of the same logic thinking which made up our expectation (H1<sub>A</sub>) in the first place. Some of the events had probably occurred several times during a single play session (e.g., high ammunition and few zombies) and maybe events were taking place over a longer period of time (e.g., several minutes). This must have made it difficult for the participants to assign memorial moments to each of the question categories, and therefore we speculate that they might have relied on logic instead when rating the three event-questions. To conclude, the results either confirms H1<sub>A</sub> and rejects the H1<sub>B</sub> or in the worst case are inconclusive in both the matter.</p><p>While conducting the experiment, we observed a range of problems we had not initially thought of. One issue was that the total impression of illumination coming from a screen changes according to the content displayed. For instance, if a player is playing a first-person perspective game, as in the first experiment, and walks into darker areas the perceived luminance of the screen will decrease. This damping might have emphasized the visual stimulus in a way that made it appear stronger than intended. Another problem was the effect of having the black frame surrounding the game visuals, as previous presence studies have found that applying smaller displays will decrease the feeling of presence (Lombard et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Lombard M et al (2000) Presence and television: the role of screen size, Hum Commun Res 26(1)" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR6" id="ref-link-section-d15782e1624">2000</a>). Lastly, the random position of the dot in the black frame might potentially make the dot appear right next to the enemy whom the player are currently looking at. The user’s point of attention on the screen should ideally be at the same distance from the dot each time it appears. To filter out some of these uncertainties, we instead used vibration as the distracting stimulus in the next experiment as this type of stimulus operates outside the audiovisual space, which most media occupy.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec18"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec18-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec18">Experiment 2: the tactile distraction test</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec18-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Addressed hypothesis</h3><p>The first experiment implied that the AD method does not correlate with the amount of intensity in a computer game. In the forming of the hypotheses for the second experiment, we asked ourselves what the AD method instead was indicating. The nature of questionnaires have issues which do not make them suitable for measuring real-time effects and therefore another measuring method might aid in the investigation of the AD method. Psycho-physiological heart rate (HR) measurements have earlier produced promising results in connection with scary (Jang et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Jang D et al (2002) Analysis of physiological response to two virtual environments: driving and flying simulation. Cyberpsychol Behav 5(1):11–18" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR7" id="ref-link-section-d15782e1640">2002</a>) or violent (Cameron and Ballard <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2002" title="Cameron P, Ballard M (2002) High versus low aggressive priming during video-game training: effects on violent action during game play, hostility, heart rate, and blood pressure.

It is therefore interesting to examine whether the results from the AD method would correlate with the results obtained by HR measurements. However, this required that the test was done based on material of a relevant genre or theme. The sub-hypotheses for the second experiment are as follows:</p>
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H2<sub>A</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>A person’s heart rate recordings during the experience of a conventional thriller movie are proportional to the suspense build by the narrative.</p>
                
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H2<sub>B</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>A person’s perceived intensity of events in a conventional thriller movie is proportional to the suspense build by the narrative.</p>
                
                  <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">H2<sub>C</sub>
                           </h3>
                  <p>A person’s heart rate during a conventional thriller movie experience is proportional to BOTH a person’s perceived intensity of events in a conventional thriller movie AND the minimum amount of tactile distraction needed to attract the person’s attention (because the amount of mental processing and the changes in heart rate and perceived intensity due to suspense in fact all are indicators of presence as immersion).</p>
                <p>H2<sub>B</sub> is included in the experimental hypotheses as we speculate that the non-linear nature of games made it hard for the participants to answer the three intensity ratings in the questionnaires. As a movie clip is applied as test material in this experiment, we wished to examine whether the intensity rating would correlate with the results from the AD method when applied to a media with a linear narrative structure. H2<sub>C</sub> will examine whether all of the three included measurement methods are monitoring the same phenomenon.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Experimental setup</h3><p>The same methodology as in the first experiment was applied. Each method was to collect repeated measurements during three selected events in a movie. It was then expected that the results from each method would carry the same characteristic pattern as if the measuring methods in fact were measuring the same phenomenon (H2<sub>C</sub>). As with the first experiment, a comparison between the obtained measurements is only possible based on the relationship between the means of each event as the scales are different. Scaling the results to the same span is not considered to be justifiable. If an unexpected result would occur in the examination of H2<sub>C</sub> it might be necessary to re-evaluate the validity of H2<sub>A</sub> and H2<sub>B</sub>.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Test material</h3><p>We speculate that the developed questionnaires from the first test caused problems when test subjects had to rate events as the questions referred to reoccurring events (which computer games are full of) and events which appeal more to the use of logic thinking rather than answers based upon the memories from the actual experience. To apply questionnaires in comparison with the AD method, the computer game used as test material in the first experiment was instead replaced by a movie clip.</p><p>Regarding choice of the test material, the movie clip had to contain a storyline with events that had a reasonable chance of inducing distinct levels of presence, as the characteristic pattern found in the results across other measuring methods and the AD method would seem more convincing than if a somewhat monotone pattern was found. Another thing to look out for was the possibility that persons appearing in the movie clip (e.g., a famous actor/actress) might have contributed to other media productions experienced by the participants. Prejudices or certain views toward a particular person may affect how the movie clip was experienced, which was undesirable. This makes it so that most Hollywood movies, reusing known actors, were inappropriate for the use as test material.</p><p>By performing a range of small viewer tests on individuals of the target group, the movie “El Laberinto del Fauno” (del Toro <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="del Toro G (2006) The Spanish movie “El laberinto del fauno”.

With its Spanish list of actors, the movie has a relatively unknown cast (seen from a Dane’s point of view), which should minimize the occurrences of prejudices among the test participants. During the viewer’s tests, Chap. 9 (and some of Chap. 10), were shown from the Scandinavian DVD version. To quickly summarize the action, a little girl has found a secret door leading to a room where a monster-like pale man is sleeping. While the girl is occupied the pale man wakes up and starts to hunt her back to the door opening. Even though the door shuts in front of her she manages to escape, before the pale man reaches her, through another door in the ceiling. According to the descriptions given by the audience, this scene was perceived to almost constantly increase in intensity and peak at the sequence where the key figure attempts to escape. Some of the individuals also referred to the pale man as “suddenly appearing comical” during a period in the scene where it is revealed that the eyes of the pale man are located in the palms of his hands. This change in perception from scary to comical might lower the immersive presence felt by the audience due to the inconsistency of a comic element in a very consistently scary setting. Based upon the statements from the viewer’s tests, the following events were selected for this experiment:</p><ul class="u-list-style-none">
                    <li>
                      <p>Event 1: Sequence where the pale man suddenly appears comical; medium level of presence expected (appears 4 min 26 s after the Chap. 9 mark)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Event 2: Sequence of the escape from the pale man; high level of presence expected (appears 6 min 5 s after the Chap. 9 mark)</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Event 3: Beginning of the subsequent chapter; low level of presence expected (appears 6 min 50 s after the Chap. 9 mark)</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                        <p>The sequence chosen for event 3 was the beginning of the next scene which by all means is out of context in relation to the two other events. As the participant had no reference for knowing any of the characters or the setting of the scene, a low level of presence was expected here.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Data collection</h3><p>Along with AD method measurements and questionnaires, heart rates were recorded with a Biopac Science Lab MP40 device.</p><p>The questionnaire had to contain new formulations of the event-based questions, adapted to fit the selected events. In general, it seemed to be the selection of logic events that resulted in a potential unreliable rating in the first test. It was therefore decided to keep “intensity” as the describing word for presence as immersion in the questions. The following three formulations were therefore asked in the questionnaires:</p><ol class="u-list-style-none">

                        <p>These questions were built around a 5-optioned Likert-scale with a rating where 1 was regarded low intensity and 5 was regarded high intensity.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23">Implementation of vibration as the adjustable distraction</h3><p>The implementation of the AD method was, in this experiment, strongly inspired by the setup of the vibration threshold experiments conducted by Verrillo (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration.

To be able to expose test participants to different strengths of a vibration stimulus, a small pc speaker was used. Speakers are basically an electromagnet that reacts according to the amount of voltage put through it. When voltage is mapped according to a sinusoid and send to the speaker, the electromagnet will alternately start to attract and push away the membrane creating vibrations. The characteristics of the vibration can be read out of the sinusoid signal sent to the speaker. Two parameters are of significance here, namely, the frequency and the amplitude (the displacement of the speaker membrane) and changing these quantities will therefore alter the properties of the vibration. As the AD method only allows for regulation of a single parameter to vary the strength of the stimulus, one of these parameters had to be kept fixed while the other could vary. Observing that frequency thresholds, in Verrillo (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration.

The frequency of the speaker was to be kept constant at 250 Hz because the skin is most sensitivity to vibrations of this frequency (Verrillo <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration.

A program, running at the computer, maintained the frequency at 250 Hz and adjusting the displacement through an implementation of the adjustable distraction algorithm. To carry on the vibration, the head of a 5 mm × 50 mm stainless steel A4 bolt (non-magnetic material) was attached to the center of the speaker membrane. The speaker was then placed onto a jack under a table in a way that the pointy bolt had free passage through a hole (with diameter of approximate 12 mm). By adjusting the jack, the bolt could then be positioned with precision in relation to the upper side of the table top (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig3">3</a>). Besides the speaker, a small USB numerical pad was connected to the computer. The “Enter” key was here marked with a small label to emphasize its significance above the rest of the buttons. The numerical pad was then placed on the table top a small distance to the right of the hole with the bolt.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-3"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig3" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 3</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3/figures/3" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig3_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-3-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-009-0140-3/MediaObjects/10055_2009_140_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="figure3" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-3-desc"><p>The setup. <i>1</i> The stainless steel bolt attached to the pc speaker, <i>2</i> a cord connecting an ohm meter to the bolt, <i>3</i> a digital ruler, <i>4</i> the jack, <i>5</i> a mirror used for reading the digital ruler while operating the setup</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3/figures/3" data-track-dest="link:Figure3 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                        <p>The table, speaker, numerical pad and a chair, for the participants to sit on, was located in a sound proof room. However, the computer was placed in an adjacent room to avoid that the appearance or the noise of it would interfere with the experiment. In front of the table, a 32″ LCD screen was used to display the movie clip. To provide the participants with the sound of the test material, a set of muffled headphones was connected to the screen. Besides mediation of sound, the used headphones also filtered out any remaining sound coming from the vibrations of the pc speaker.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec25">Procedure</h3><p>The experiment was conducted in laboratory facilities at the campus of Aalborg University in Copenhagen. The participants had not seen the particular movie clip prior to the experiment and did not suffer from any heart disorders (as far as they knew). As large parts of the clip are without any speech, it was decided to show it without subtitles to give all the same conditions independent of language skills. It was therefore ensured that none of the participants knew Spanish (the spoken language in the movie). In addition, the participants were kept indoors for at least and hour before the experiment to ensure normalized skin temperatures as low temperatures can have an effect on vibration perception (Verrillo and Bolanowski <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1986" title="Verrillo R, Bolanowski S (1986) The effects of skin temperature on the psychophysical responses to vibration on glabrous and hairy skin. J Acoust Soc Am 80(2):528–532" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR36" id="ref-link-section-d15782e1868">1986</a>). Twenty-three participants of both genders between ages 20–30 and all full-time students were part of this test. Each participant went through the procedure described in the following.</p><p>The participant was seated in the chair and asked to place the left hand at the numerical pad (with their index finger at the “return” button) and to place the right hand on the surface of the table top just above the bolt-hole. The right hand was placed in such a way that the bolt would hit around the center of the first metacarpal of the thumb (the large pad in the palm just below the thumb). This contact area was chosen as it was expected to be the area on the hand less likely to move during the experiment. The participants’ hands was to remain unclamped during the entire experiment as it previously have been shown no to have any significance in relation to the precision of the measured thresholds (Verrillo <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration.

When both hands were in place the participant would be asked, for a short period, to hold one end of an Ohm meter in the left hand while the other end was being attached to the bolt at the speaker unit. Now the jack was used to make contact between the two ends of the circuit by gently decreasing the distance between the bolt and the skin of the participant (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig4">4</a>). As soon as the Ohm meter displayed a reading, the bolt would just barely touch the skin. To ensure full contact, the bolt was then raised 1 mm. This process is necessary as the level to which the bolt is pressed toward the skin has an effect on the perception of vibrations (Verrillo <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration.

                        <p>The next phase of the experiment was dedicated to an investigation of the vibration threshold when the participant was unaffected by the test material. In this process, the participant was asked to wear the headphones while he or she was being exposed to different levels of vibration. The adjustable distraction search algorithm was used here, but only on the single participant (<i>n</i> = 1) to find the minimum level at which the vibrations were perceived. Instructions were given that the Enter button on the numerical pad should be pressed if vibrations on the hand were perceived. During this phase, the headphones emitted white noise to make sure that the vibrations were felt and not heard. As white noise (as well as silence) is assumed not to contain any immersive content it served the additional purpose of removing yet another uncertainty. Since the sound track of the movie clip replaced the white noise in the headphones in the subsequent phase of the experiment, participants would be exposed to vibrations both at the ear level (vibrations of the sound) and at their right hand (vibrations from the bolt). Therefore, white noise was used during the initial phase to create similar ear vibrations as it is not known whether these vibrations would influence the perception threshold of the vibrations sensed in the hand. Likewise, noise was displayed on the LCD screen to ensure that light coming from the screen in both phases of the experiment would not have a significant effect on the vibration results. When the threshold was identified and registered, the actual experiment could begin. The test participant was then equipped with electrodes (at both ankles and the right wrist) to be able to measure changes in heart rate (HR) during the playback of the movie clip. The participant was then reminded that the button on the numerical pad should be pressed if vibrations in the hand were noticed during the movie experience. The playback of the movie clip and the program which managed the occurrence of events was then started simultaneously to ensure synchronization. After the movie clip the participants were asked to fill out the post-test questionnaires.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26">Results</h3><p>As the relationship between the event-means obtained through each method is of importance, the results will be listed as graphs.

                        <p>The first part of the experiment, determining the threshold for perceivable vibration of each test participant, returned a mean threshold of 275.2 millivolts (mV) amplitude from peak-to-peak (p–p) of the sinusoid signal provided to the speaker. The standard deviation of the thresholds was rather high at 177.5 mV p–p.

At all the events, 215 mV peak-to-peak was returned.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Discussion of the tactile distraction test</h3><p>Prior to the experiment, it was expected that the results from both questionnaires and heart rate measurements would be similar to the results obtained through the AD method. The questionnaires (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Fig5">5</a>) and the HR measurements tend to correlate in their measures at event 1 and 2 (event 1 was rated lower than event 2). However, the methods do not return the same indication of how event 3 should be rated according to the two other events. The questionnaires returned a very low score where the HR measurements indicated medium intensity. A speculation, which might explain why HR results differ in the last event, could be that a transition from one scene to another occurred in the movie clip between event 2 and 3 where new characters and a new location were shown to the participants without proper introduction. The incoherence of the latter scene could have left the participants in a state where they might expect an imminent closure to the experiment. This new intense “real-life” situation could have raised the test participants’ heart rate to a relatively high level while they still rated the third event in the movie clip with a low intensity score. With this as a very likely cause, the H2<sub>A</sub> and H2<sub>B</sub> could be accepted.</p><p>The results from the AD method show a very distinct pattern from the questionnaires and the HR measurements. Here, the same stimulus strength was returned for all the events. This clearly underlines that the AD method <i>in its current form</i> does not measure the same phenomenon as the two other measuring methods and that H2<sub>C</sub> therefore can be discarded.</p><p>While discarding the hypothesis, the authors want to emphasize the words “in its current form.” It was unexpected to find this great variance in the recorded vibration thresholds, due to the consistent findings in Verrillo (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1962" title="Verrillo R (1962) Investigation of some parameters of the cutaneous threshold for vibration. J Acoust Soc Am 34(11):1768–1773" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR35" id="ref-link-section-d15782e2034">1962</a>). This entails that the vibration strength presented at an event probably is perceived very differently according to the threshold of the test participant. For instance, it could be reasoned that a vibration displacement of 300 mV p–p would be perceived stronger by a person with a threshold of 150 mV p–p, than a person with threshold 290 mV p–p. The adjustable distraction algorithm, originally designed in relation to a visual stimulus, showed to be vulnerable to this variance especially when using a low number of test subjects per evaluation round (<i>n</i>). For instance, the 188-strength-evaluation round in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#Tab5">5</a> is entirely determined by the non-responses made by test participants, which had a higher threshold 188 mV p–p. In experiment 1 where a visual stimulus was applied, the perceivable thresholds were not this big an issue as the screen is build from discrete pixels. Here, all test participants with a normal sight probably had a perceivable threshold of a circle of 1 pixel. To eliminate the influence of significant variation in perception thresholds of the used distraction signal, a thorough screening process should be conducted pre-test.</p><p>Finally, it is worth mentioning the black cells in the tables from the AD method. These cells represent all the cases where test participants did not react on the presented stimulus even though they were expected to do so. This indicates that the movie clip is the decisive factor in whether a response was triggered or not in over 26% (6/23) of the test participants. We suspect that the underlying reason behind the missing responses is that the movie clip did induce more immersive presence than the mediation of noise. It therefore demanded a stronger distraction in order to break. This indeed supports the paradigm of the AD method, namely that presence is as strong as the minimum amount of stimuli required to break it.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec28"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec28-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec28">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec28-content"><p>The adjustable distraction (AD) method has the potential to objectively measure immersive presence at chosen events during any media experience. The method is based on the tracking of responses to stimuli of a variable strength, which are adjusted in order to find the minimum stimuli strength at which presence as immersion can be broken. Its usefulness was investigated in two cases, each applying a distinct stimulus (visual/tactile) and a different media (computer game/movie).</p><p>The results returned by experiment 1 made it clear that the AD method applying a visual distraction could perform measurements several times during a test session without being significantly intrusive in relation to the test participants’ original experience (confirmation of H1<sub>C</sub>). The results of the first experiment also showed that the AD method is not proportional to the degree of experienced (or at least the rated) intensity in a computer game (rejection of H1<sub>B</sub>). However, the results also suggest that the measurements from the AD method using visual distraction might be giving more comprehensive indication of presence as immersion (rather than just the intensity dimension) as the results were supported by flow theory.</p><p>Experiment 2 produced results confirming H2<sub>A</sub> and H2<sub>B</sub>, namely that the heart rate and the perceived intensity of the movie experience was proportional to the suspense build by the narrative. However, the results investigating H2<sub>C</sub> indicated the AD method cannot be used with tactile distraction if a proper screening process (to level out threshold variances) is not included in the experiment.</p><p>Therefore, the next logical step for future experiments would be to incorporate a screening process when applying tactile distraction as the adjustable stimulus. Furthermore, the implications of the experiments are conditional on the possibility that results from this study can be transferred to a population of an equal gender ratio. Considering that both executed experiments were conducted on groups with a majority of male participants makes it evident that future work is needed, which encompasses gender balanced groups.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec29"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec29-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec29">Future perspectives</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec29-content"><p>In the future, a range of aspects regarding the AD method are subjects for experiments. First and foremost research could be conducted on how to further develop the AD method to encompass another mechanism to present adjustable distractions, which account for the variance in perception thresholds. This initiative would in theory (if it is possible to develop) entail that all test subjects in each evaluation group are exposed to a stimulus which is perceived to be of equal strength. In other words: even though each participant in an evaluation group is exposed to vibrations which differ in amplitude, all participants would (due to differences in, for e.g., fat percentage, amount of hair) perceive the particular vibrations as being of the same strength.</p><p>As the AD method showed promising results with the use of a visual signal as the distraction more extensive research and development of the method could be interesting. For instance, eye-tracking techniques could be applied to make sure that the visual dot always is at the same distance from the gaze of the participant. Image processing techniques could also be utilized to regulate the visual stimulus according to, e.g., the mean brightness of the screen in order to ensure that the strength of the stimulus is perceived equally independent of the light and colors of the virtual environment.</p><p>As the two experiments have been very concerned with the evaluation of the content of media products, future studies could attempt to evaluate the relevance of the AD method in the context of media form (e.g., screen size, surround sound vs. stereo). As form has been reported (Lombard et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2000" title="Lombard M et al (2000) Presence and television: the role of screen size, Hum Commun Res 26(1)" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-009-0140-3#ref-CR6" id="ref-link-section-d15782e2084">2000</a>) to influence presence, the AD method might also have potential here.</p></div></div></section>
