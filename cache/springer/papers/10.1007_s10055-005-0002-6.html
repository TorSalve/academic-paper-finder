    <meta name="dc.description" content="For the past few years, the storytelling research domain has raised the interest of several researchers from different areas (such as interactive drama, computer games, intelligent learning environment etc.), mainly because stories are an important vehicle to structure the human knowledge and past experience, and even to help people to behave in a social context. In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters&#8217; interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children&#8217;s thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture&#8212;Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children&#8217;s storytelling activities."/>

In this paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters’ interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children’s thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic architecture—Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA). SAGA aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such <i>services</i> to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated SAGA with Teatrix, a collaborative virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of SAGA in children’s storytelling activities.</p></div></div></section>

                    <p>Co-construction: participate in the construction of the narrative.</p>

                </ul>
                     <p>In this paper, we present an approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters’ interactions during the story creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children’s thoughts and needs must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience during such activity.</p><p>To prove the validity of such an approach an open architecture was developed – the Support And Guidance Architecture (SAGA)—which does not see each child only as a spectator of the story, but asks her to put herself in the skin of a story character, and together with other children, create their own story. Each child has the possibility of directing a character and her character’s directives not only influence the story but also contribute to its creation. In addition, children are also asked to reflect upon their actions: what (and why) the characters are doing? what are they thinking? and, what children think about their character’s thoughts?</p><p>The major goal of developing SAGA as an open architecture is to allow other existing applications to take advantage of the features provided by SAGA with a reduced amount of the effort of integration and change. The applications for which SAGA is designed are mainly story creation applications from different domains and contexts (e.g., games, educational software, etc.).</p><p>This paper is organised as follows: first, we present some motivation behind the development of SAGA, and then the architecture is explained in detail (first the theory used and then the different components that compose the architecture). The Teatrix application is introduced, followed by the presentation of the set of procedures taken for integrating SAGA with Teatrix. The evaluation study of the integration of SAGA with Teatrix is presented by explaining the setting, procedures and the results obtained. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Motivation</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><p>With the design and development of SAGA, we aimed not only at devising some design guidance for the achievement of an interactive story creation experience, but also to provide an implemented framework that could be <i>plugged in</i> and used by other existing applications for different domains and contexts (e.g., games, educational software, etc.).</p><p>The philosophy behind the development of SAGA followed the premise that every story element defined and used within the architecture can be parameterised by the “ <i>client</i>” application, that is the characters, props, story world, actions that can be performed by the characters, and even the initial story situation can be specified by the application using the services of SAGA.</p><p>Although SAGA aims at reaching the largest possible number of target applications, its applicability follows the principle that the story creation activity is done in a collaborative setting in which the children control the story characters. Children have a direct influence on the behaviour of the characters and indirectly on the story world—featuring the concept of <i>agency</i> defined by Murray [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Murray JH (1997) Hamlet on the Holodeck—the future of the narrative cyberspace.

This approach merges the actor, author and spectator roles, since children are invited to act in an interactive story along with the other characters, to create/author such story by acting in it and to understand the other characters’ actions—being a spectator—in order to respond to their behaviours. This new concept aims at overcoming one of the typical problems of interactive narratives/stories—the higher degree of freedom that is given to the user to intervene in the narrative flow, the weaker is the power given to the author to decide on the progress of the story [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Clarke G, Mitchell (2001) Film and development of interactive narrative.

The goal is to promote the justification and context of the behaviours taken by the characters (system or child-controlled) during the story progression. This justification aims at providing the children with some <i>meaning-making</i> and <i>meaning-finding</i> [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bolton G (1998) Acting in classroom drama: a critical analysis.

If a child-controlled character is unhappy with the successful achievement of its goals, this may mean that the child does not agree with the role assigned to her character and she might benefit from some support and guidance. In most cases, the support and guidance mechanism triggers a reflection moment, in which the children are asked to comment on the character’s behaviour in the story or to reflect upon the other characters’ behaviour. Based on the classifications given by the children, the architecture tries to adapt the character’s behaviour and positioning within the story.</p><p>Further, it is evident that there is an additional need to support and guide the children during the dramatic game, to help them to engage deeply during story creation and to consider the extent to which children are actually <i>present</i> in the story. By supporting and motivating children to reflect about their characters’ actions within the story world, the goal is to show children that more than influencing the flow of the story with their characters’ directives within the story, the system cares about <i>them</i> [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Self J (1999) The defining characteristics of intelligent tutoring systems research: ITS’s care, precisely.

However, there is not a standard or a unanimously accepted definition of what characterises the software architecture of a system, during the past few years there have been several contributions from different researchers in the software engineering field. One of the concepts that played an important role in the definition of our concept of an <i>open architecture</i> was the concept proposed by Booch et al.

The approach taken while devising SAGA was similar to the one proposed by Booch and started with the identification of what were the major competences that it should encompass.

                     <p>The development of SAGA was based on the assumption that the story creation process is constituted by two distinct phases: story definition/preparation and story construction (de facto). In the first phase the children would define the basic elements for their story: the cast and setting, and in the second they build their collaborative story. To integrate SAGA in any story creation application, it is necessary that the latter complies with two important properties: </p><ol class="u-list-style-none">

The theory behind the definition of the concept has its roots in Propp’s narrative morphology [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Propp V (1968) Morphology of the folktale.

The story definition stands for a variable sequence of two different constituents: an initial story situation and variable story schema. The first can be seen as the situation in which the characters and their inter-relations are introduced, the story is situated in terms of temporal and spatial localisation, the initial positioning of the characters, and the definition of the goal of the story. The variable story schema is a sequence of <i>functions</i>
                        <sup><a href="#Fn2"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>—each of them represented by a letter-, which starts with a villainy (<i>A</i>) or with a lack (<i>a</i>), and may develop accordingly along the upper or the lower branch of the schema, meaning that it is characterised: by the existence of a struggle (<i>H</i>) and a victory over the villain (<i>I</i>)—in this case the sequence should start with a villainy; or, by the existence of a difficult task (<i>M</i>) and the solution of such a task (<i>N</i>)—in this case the sequence should start with a lack.

Another important aspect that derives from the application of Propp’s theory is the implicit definition of roles associated with the characters—which are named by him as<i> dramatis personae</i>. Following Propp’s perspective, each of the<i> dramatis personae</i> has a specific set of functions associated, which determines when the character must intervene in the story. The<i> dramatis personae</i> defined by Propp are: villain, donor, helper, princess (and father), dispatcher, hero and the false hero.</p><p>After analysing Propp’s narrative structure and examining it with respect to the needs and goals of the architecture, it was possible to come to a simplified version of such variable story schema, with a reduced number of <i>functions</i> and consequently with fewer <i>types of character</i> or <i>dramatis personae</i>.

                     <p>The simplification of the variable story scheme was mostly based on a field study conducted with the aim of analysing children’s written stories. Because this study was not a large-scale one, it can only be understood as an initial exploration and its results can only give us an indication of what kind of <i>functions</i> are most frequently included in children’s stories [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Machado I, Martinho C, Paiva A (1999) Once upon a time.

Each plot point is then represented by a set of generic goals, and each of them is equally valid for reaching the particular plot point. For example the plot point <i>villainy</i> can be decomposed into five different generic goals: <i>theft</i>, <i>kidnapping someone</i>, <i>casting of a spell</i>, <i>imprisonment</i> or <i>order to kill someone</i>. Although, these different generic goals are quite specific and folktale-oriented, it is always possible to generalise them and apply them to a more realistic and modern context.</p><p>Each <i>generic goal</i> is translated into a <i>plan</i> that guarantees the achievement of the <i>plot point</i>. Each <i>plan</i> is a hierarchical representation of goals and actions—similar to—that is, which can be decomposed into a set of sub-goals and ultimately into a set of atomic actions (the actions performed by the characters in the story world). The planning methodology adopted in SAGA was hierarchical task network (HTN) planning, which is an artificial intelligence (AI) planning methodology that creates plans by task decomposition. HTN planning can be seen as a generalisation of the classical planning problem, where in addition to the primitive actions in the domain, the domain writer also specifies a set of non-primitive actions, and provides schemas for reducing the non-primitive actions into other primitive or non-primitive actions. It is a process where the tasks (non-primitive actions) are decomposed into smaller sub-tasks until primitive actions are found that can be performed directly [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 10" title="Kambhampati S, Mali A, Srivastava B (1998) Hybrid planning for partially hierarchical domains.

The successive steps taken were the definition of the interfaces between these components and the collaboration threads between such components.

As all the components, the<i> facilitator</i> was developed as a stand-alone program that can be invoked remotely and can collaborate with a distributed application. Meaning that each <i>client</i> application, just has to know the facilitator’s IP address, communicates with it through a message-exchange mechanism.</p><p>This message-exchanging process is only possible because the architecture provides a set of public methods, which have a well-defined application interface using a clear protocol and have a black-box behaviour, in the sense that they present an identified behaviour to the <i>client</i> application but all the implementation and development decisions are hidden from the latter.</p><p>The messages that are exchanged between the<i> facilitator</i> component and the <i>client</i> application are the following:

The story elements refer to the scenes where the story will happen, the cast of characters, which was previously chosen in the <i>client</i> application; the roles associated with those characters, which will determine the behaviours and actions played by the characters and the props that may exist within the scenes. The <i>client</i> application can do this by sending an XML file with the current story elements. If the <i>client</i> application does not fulfil the requirements defined by the architecture, the latter will perform the needed adaptations.

To define the initial story situation, a set of templates was established, and each of them is defined by a set of minimum requisites that must be satisfied to have an <i>initial story situation</i>—the definition of the templates was based on the work of Propp [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Propp V (1968) Morphology of the folktale.

This set of minimum requisites is defined by: the number and type of characters already specified in the story creation, and, the type of props existing in the story world. Scriptwriter defines two different types of templates:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>

                </ul>
                     <p>Additionally, SAGA defines a categorisation on the nature or genre of the story (e.g., mystery, magical or journey). This categorisation reflects the type of situation that is planned for the story and eventually also the type of props that were chosen by the children. Although, the motive can be established at a large-grain size through the type of story template and its category, there is also the need to establish a set of challenges to be discovered throughout the story progression. The scriptwriter is also responsible for adding new characters to the set of story elements sent by the <i>client</i> application, in order to fulfil the requirements of a specific initial story situation. This information is passed to the next component in the form of an XML file.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec8"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec8-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec8">Narrative Guidance Engine</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"><p>The <i>narrative guidance engine</i> (NGE) starts its task when it receives the information from the scriptwriter. With the complete information about the elements that constitute the <i>initial story situation</i> and by taking into account the <i>variable story schema</i> (explained in the previous section), the NGE starts to generate the space of all <i>plot points</i> for a particular story template. The generation of the space of all <i>plot points</i> is performed in a phased way. This decision was based on the fact that the space of all <i>plot points</i> is directly proportional to the complexity of the story and that most of those paths turn out to be useless. Therefore, the decision was to perform a kind of just-in-time generation, since at each moment of the story we have to deal with the children’s decisions (since these are the ones directing characters’ actions) and evaluate which is the best path to follow.</p><p>To do this, we defined an evaluation function that has to assess, which are the candidates for the next plot point. This evaluation function takes into account several different factors:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>Which generic goal was chosen for the accomplishment of the previous plot point? For example, if the previous plot point was <i>villainy</i> and if the generic goal associated with it was <i>kidnapping someone</i>, the next possible plot point would be <i>counteraction</i> by the hero character. The <i>counteraction</i> plot point is characterised by a response of the hero character, who must respond to the <i>villainy</i> caused by the villain character. In this case, the <i>counteraction</i> plot point is the next plot point and only the plans associated with the <i>counteraction</i> of a kidnapping are going to be generated;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The action already taken since the last plot point (which can be used to match the ones needed to reach one of the next candidates and to understand how many are still needed to conclude it successfully).</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                     <p>By doing this, the evaluation function tries to make sure that the selected path creates a fulfilling experience for the children, in terms of improving their concept of narrative and also providing a rich collaborative experience. It is important to note that although we can delineate an overall structure of the story, the story is defined by the children and stays completely undefined until they start to create it.</p><p>Our aim is to try to guide them, in order to guarantee a better understanding of what their roles are in the story and to provide them with any support about what is being felt by the other characters, and why they are performing in the way that they are.

This <i>narrative agent</i> uses its sensors to get information from the story world and based on this information decides whether it should provide a change to the story world or to provide some support or guidance to the children, implicitly or explicitly through its actuators. This decision process is performed with the help of the agent’s <i>narrative memory</i>. The narrative memory is organised in the form of episodes and contains information about the story progression from each story character’s point of view. Each episode is constituted from three important events: crisis, climax and resolution [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Freytag G (1900) Freytag’s technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art.

At the end of the story creation activity, the <i>director</i> can use the various character-centred stories stored in its memory to generate a unique story that reflects the overall experience of the story creation activity.</p><p>In order to perform its task, the <i>director</i> maintains an internal model of the story world and implements a <i>mind</i> associated with each story character
<sup><a href="#Fn5"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>. The specification of the rules and functioning of such <i>minds</i> is determined according to the roles played by each character in the story. During the story creation process, the <i>director</i> has four different activities:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>To update the internal world model and investigate the possibility of generating an episode. To do this, the <i>director agent</i> inspects the characters’ goals in order to find conflicts among characters. When it detects a conflict of goals between two characters, it adds to its memory a new episode in each of their stories. This update task happens whenever the<i> director</i> receives information from the<i> facilitator</i> component.</p>

                    <p>To check whether the current plot point has been achieved, in order to make sure that the story progresses. In case of success the<i> director agent</i> asks the NGE for the next plot point.</p>

The theory behind the design of this component was based on the research of Dorothy Heathcote on acting in classroom drama [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bolton G (1998) Acting in classroom drama: a critical analysis.

The idea is that a child is asked to freeze her character’s actions and explain the meaning of her character’s current behaviour. For Wagner [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bolton G (1998) Acting in classroom drama: a critical analysis.

Feeling without reflection may simply be experienced and forgotten; with reflection it can become an insight, an understanding that makes possible later modification of behaviour in the real world”.</p><p>Each reflection moment has a statement about what a specific character has done, which tries to make the children think and justify their agreement/disagreement with this statement. The justifications are done through the selection of three different levels of agreement: fully agree, agree and disagree. The sentences presented in the reflection moments are divided into three different categories: personality, behaviour and emotional (see Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#Tab2">2</a> for examples of sentences in each of these categories). The definition of these categories was mainly driven by the opportunities they raise to intervene and provide guidance to the children.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Categories of the Reflection Sentences</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6/tables/2"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                     <p>The reflection engine receives from the<i> director agent</i>, the information about the type of conflict that generated the need of a reflection moment. Based on this information, the reflection engine decides which category of reflection should be used. It is important to note that the sentences presented to the child do not only have to refer to his/her character, but can also refer to any other character of the story. By this way, it is possible to understand the child’s opinion about his/her character performance and also his/her opinion about the performance of the other characters. A reflection moment can be composed of one or more interactions.</p><p>The analysis of the answers provided by the child is done by the reflection engine, which informs the director agent of the result. This result can assume two different forms:

After attributing a role to an actor, the cast has to be placed inside the scenes. The positioning of props and characters inside a scene corresponds to their positioning in the initial story situation—for further details on the character’s architecture developed within Teatrix see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Machado, Paiva A, Prada R (2001) Is the wolf angry or ... just hungry?—inspecting, disclosing and modifying characters’ minds.

Since this phase of Teatrix is a collaborative one, each child participating in the story performance must select the character he/she wants to control. Each child controls/directs a character during the story creation process. All characters that are not chosen by the group of children automatically become autonomous characters.

                     <p>To control her character, the child has a set of atomic actions available from which she chooses and then orders her character to do. The direct orders that the child is able to ask her character to perform are for example: <i>walk to</i> &lt;<i>object</i>&gt;, <i>use</i> &lt;<i>object</i>&gt;, <i>talk to</i> &lt;<i>character</i>&gt;, <i>activate</i> &lt;<i>object</i>&gt;, <i>give</i> &lt;<i>object</i>&gt; and <i>get</i> &lt;<i>object</i>&gt;.

                  </li>
                </ol><p> The first integration issue was overcome by developing a small application that translated an XML file with a story structure produced in Teatrix into another XML file that obeyed the rules defined by SAGA. The second and third integration issues were solved by integrating an agent within Teatrix’s environment, which had two major functions:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>To sense the story world and transmit such information to the <i>facilitator</i> component.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>To act, through its effectors—which were defined according to the specification of Teatrix, in the story in order to accommodate the action directives sent by the <i>facilitator</i> component.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                     <p>The last integration issue, and maybe the most important one, was solved by introducing a new interface within Teatrix, which was called the <i>hot-seating</i> tool. This new tool integrates the reflection moments, and provided the opportunity to address children in order to promote a better understanding about their characters’ actions within the story (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#Fig7">7</a>). It is through this interface that SAGA interacts and receives information about each child’s view of what is happening in the story. Whenever this interface appears to the child the story creation process ends—this is similar to freezing the actions being carried out by the other characters.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 7</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-005-0002-6/MediaObjects/10055_2005_2_Fig7_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-7-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-005-0002-6/MediaObjects/10055_2005_2_Fig7_HTML.gif" alt="figure7" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-7-desc"><p>

This school organises its main educational activities within different rooms. In each of the different rooms, there are differentiated spaces where various activities take place simultaneously, in accordance with the choice and interest of the children. The evaluation study was conducted during the school year of 2001–2002, with a group of six children aged between 8 and 11 years old (three girls and three boys).</p><p>In this evaluation study, we started by introducing the application and provided some help to overcome some initial problems.

In these sessions, children had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the application and to get some proficiency in how to use the application (they worked in pairs).</p><p>In the second phase of the evaluation, a more structured and pre-defined task was introduced in which the children were asked to create a story in Teatrix from a pre-defined story setup. This second phase of the evaluation was composed of three different threads, which meant as well three different stories, and three different story <i>setups</i>. The definition of these story <i>setups</i> was based on Harry Potter stories, because the plot and theme of such stories is well accepted and known by the children. It was interesting to note that the success of Harry Potter stories gave the children an extra interest to participate in the study, mainly because they felt they were creating their own Harry Potter stories—with their own characters.</p><p>In these threads, children would participate in groups of three (or two) and each group had the chance to choose which character they wanted to control during the story creation activity. This second evaluation phase was performed inTeatrix‘s second option—the <i>on-stage</i> phase.

                     <p>Due to the contemporaneous nature of our research, we opted to apply a case-study methodology. In this evaluation study, we followed an approach that merges Yin’s and Eisenhardt’s perspectives [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Eisenhardt KM (1989) Building theories from case study research.

To define such research questions, we considered the following research areas: empathy, role taking and role-playing. Besides grounding the definition of the research questions raised in this evaluation study, these may also provide us with some theoretical basis for analysis of the data collected.</p><p>The concepts of empathy, role-play and role taking are major ingredients in the research area of Drama Education. From Heathcote’s definition of educational drama [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bolton G (1998) Acting in classroom drama: a critical analysis. Stoke-on-Trent, Trentham" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d71325e2134">3</a>], it is possible to envision its application in our research domain, that is, the product of the integration of SAGA with Teatrix application is a collaborative environment in which the children engage in active role-taking situations. The rules to take part in such situations are not pre-defined, since children act only in response to:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>What they feel in that moment</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>What they are expected to do in those situations (role-play)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>What the others do and finally</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>How the others felt in response to others’ actions.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                     <p>By leaving the plot undetermined, we provide children with the opportunity to feel tension in the form of a problem, a challenge that must be solved, a threat, a question. From this tension, they move to the recognition of the problem and its implications, which would lead to a cognitive and affective response. In Heathcote’s opinion, emotion is at the heart of the drama experience, but each child should be kept in a safe position, like the self-spectator, which remains safely protected because it is a drama experience but at the same time both engaged and detached.</p><p>By experiencing the emotions conveyed in the drama experience, children can experience an empathic relation with the story and with its characters, and they can go through the three different levels of accomplishment identified by Stein and Thompson [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Stein (1964) On the problem of empathy, trans. Waltraut Stein. The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#ref-CR28" id="ref-link-section-d71325e2165">28</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Thompson (2001) Empathy and consciousness. J Consciousness Stud 8(5–7):1–32" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#ref-CR29" id="ref-link-section-d71325e2168">29</a>], which means that they can watch the experience of others in the drama experience—even if he/she is the one playing one role, what is happening within the drama is not happening with him/her but with his/her character, the child can then transpose himself/herself to the place of the character in order to understand the character’s experience, and finally to react in accordance to his/her interpretation of the experience. The ability to transpose oneself into the place of the character is realised in SAGA through the triggering of a reflection moment, which aims at providing the children with the opportunity to reflect about what is happening with her character or with the other characters.</p><p>In these reflection moments, SAGA assumes the position of a role-player leader, and debates with the children the content and reasons behind the actions taken by the characters within the story. This kind of debriefing may equip the children with a more flexible way of thinking and understanding of what the others do. These role-taking and role-playing activities are not only hoped to develop the children’s empathic behaviour, but also provide them with the possibility to relate the lessons learnt from the drama experiences to real life situations.</p><p>From these domains that mingle in so many ways, it is possible to define the following research questions:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>Does the product of SAGA and Teatrix promote a transfer of emotions?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Do children understand the roles of their characters?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is there an understanding of the role played by the other characters?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is there an understanding of the emotions experienced by the other characters?</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                     <p>After having established the research questions, and following Yin’s methodology [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Yin RK (1989) Case study research: design and methods.

In Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6#Tab3">3</a>, the units of analysis are presented.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 Units of analysis</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-005-0002-6/tables/3"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                     <p>These units of<i> analysis</i> were used during the observations of the interactions with the application and for the definition of the structure of the post-interaction interviews. The data-collection task was achieved from two different sources: direct observation and post-interaction interviews.</p><p>The direct observation method played an important role during the conducting of this case study evaluation, since it allowed the researcher to collect some data related to ambience conditions and behaviour patterns that took place during the interactions with the application. Through this method it was also possible to capture each child’s opinion about the software, especially their comments after news features had been added. During the second phase of evaluation, the direct observation method took the form of <i>participant observation</i>, since the researchers doing the evaluation played different roles not only during the study, but also in the classroom’s usual activities. Nevertheless, the researchers always had in their minds that they needed to keep some distance in order not to put in risk the evaluation being carried. The interviews assumed the form of focussed interviews, which allowed the researcher to have a set of pre-defined questions—basically, a set of guidelines—and to elaborate on these questions when the targets provided different opinions on the matters being asked. By elaborating on the questions, it is possible to detect other factors that may influence the situation being studied.</p><p>The data collected was then analysed by using the content analysis method, which followed an approach derived from cognitive science. This approach includes the creation of decision maps and mental models. These decision maps attempt to represent the relationships between ideas, beliefs, attitudes, and information available to the researcher when making a decision within a text. Mental models are groups or networks of inter-related concepts that are thought to reflect conscious or sub-conscious perceptions of reality. To do this, we analysed the data collected and converted the text obtained from the direct observation and the interviews into a map of concepts and relations.</p><p>Following, we present each of the<i> units of analysis</i> and a set of examples, taken from the data collection, and the relations and hypothesis that we established from them:</p>

                      <p>Interpretation: Most of the times children direct their character to <i>walk</i>, <i>catch prop</i> or to <i>use prop</i>. By analysing each of the stories, it is possible to contextualise these actions, and conclude that in most of the occasions children use them to accomplish the role that has been assigned to their character. This may imply that they did understand what their character’s role was, within each story, and tried to direct it inline with such role.</p>

                      <p>Interpretation: The examples show that children were, in most of the cases, aware of what the other characters were doing and of the implications that those actions would have towards their character. From the examples, it is possible to realise that when facing the other characters—in most of the cases such characters played the rival role—they acted quite enthusiastically and they were quite engaged in the interactions. In addition, whenever they address such a character the expressions used transmitted some identification between children and their character, in the sense that what happened to their character happened also to them, and their character’s tasks would be their own tasks. Further, it is also possible to find some actions, or even consequences of some actions that are not possible within the software but which are imagined or interpreted by the children, such as: <i>N</i> says: “she may be on top of the tree”! This kind of interpretation happened not only in the beginning of the study, mostly because children think that in such an application it is possible to do everything.</p>

                      <p>Interpretation: In this case, it was not possible to find any evidences that would give us any information about this unit of analysis. In our view, this may happen because the graphical representation of the character in Teatrix application is achieved by using 2D-sprites, which do not allow facial expressiveness. In order to overcome such a limitation the emotional expression was introduced within the <i>hot-seating</i> tool, but this would imply that children would have to open a window in order to know their character’s emotional state or the other characters’ emotional state.</p>

                      <p>Interpretation: From the examples collected, it is possible to imply different emotional states of the children. Children are quite enthusiastic about the story and their involvement with their character and story is high, which sometimes is translated into joy and happiness when they manage to achieve the story goal and other times is translated into disappointment and some exasperation when they cannot do what they want. Additionally, it is possible to find one example of one child that was quite sad right after his character had achieved its goal—meaning that although everything happened as it should, the child was not satisfied with the length of the story and its degree of complexity. It was also possible to identify some occasions where children were quite focused on what they were doing.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                
              <p>The results obtained show that:
</p><ul class="u-list-style-dash">
                  <li>
                    <p>In terms of transfer of emotions from the story, in particular from the character to the children controlling such character, it was possible to identify some children’s behaviours, which showed that they were happy when their characters successfully achieved a challenge in the story, and in opposition they were quite sad and angry when another character did something bad to their character.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>It was also possible to conclude that children understood the roles of their characters, meaning that the directives that they gave them were meaningful for the achievement of the role played by them. However, sometimes they expressed some disappointment with the performance of their characters, since they wanted them to “run” not to simply walk.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The interactions promoted between characters also showed that they stayed in character, and that in most of the cases children understood not only their character’s role in the story but also the role of the other characters of the story. However, there is evidence that at least in two different occasions children were mistaken about the role played by another character (Example: “<i>N</i> says: “catch the mushroom also”!, “It caught the wooden stick by himself, it wasn’t me or <i>R</i> caught it”—at this point <i>N</i> doesn’t understand that Tobias, the other character had given him a wooden stick because it may be needed to face Baddy—misunderstanding”.).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Relating to the issue about feeling the emotions of the characters, it was not possible to find any evidence on this issue. The reasons behind this, as has been stated before may be connected with the technical limitations of the application (Teatrix). On the other hand, in relation to the emotions felt by the children, there was some evidence that showed that children’s emotions go from a positive to a negative pole when their character succeeds or does not succeed to overcome a difficult task.</p>

With this approach we aim to provide new opportunities to children to explore different situations, engage in role-taking and role-playing situations, which provide them with inline reflection opportunity that would help them to act in those situations or in future ones.</p><p>Our approach was implemented in the form of an open architecture, which aims at providing already existent story creation applications with a support and guidance mechanism. This support and guidance mechanism is achieved through the integration of different components in SAGA, which have different roles throughout the story creation activity such as a dynamic scriptwriter, an NGE, a drama manager and a reflection engine.</p><p>When comparing the children’s experiences with Teatrix- by itself, and with Teatrix and SAGA, it is possible to conclude that a better job is done by the product of the integration of both applications, since there are some results that indicate that children have a better understanding of the role-taking and role-playing situations they engage in, and by analysing the story creation process it is also possible to conclude that children did not limit to interact with the other characters, they had a main task to carry out, the story and achieving its main goal.</p><p>The results of the integration of SAGA with Teatrix application cannot be understood as conclusive evidence of the benefit of SAGA, but as some encouraging results suggest that SAGA can produce similar results with other applications. In the near future, there is the possibility to study the integration of SAGA with a commercial application from Lego.</p></div></div></section>
