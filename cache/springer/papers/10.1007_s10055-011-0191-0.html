The three interaction modes were derived from an initial descriptive theory of cultural learning as instruction, observation and action. A major aim was to ascertain whether task performance was similar to the development of understanding of the cultural context reached by participation in the virtual environment. A hypothesis was that if task performance is equivalent to understanding and engagement, we might be able to evaluate the success of virtual heritage environments (through engagement and education), without having to annoy the user with post-experience questionnaires.

The three interaction modes were derived from an initial descriptive theory of cultural learning as instruction, observation and action. A major aim was to ascertain whether task performance was similar to the development of understanding of the cultural context reached by participation in the virtual environment. A hypothesis was that if task performance is equivalent to understanding and engagement, we might be able to evaluate the success of virtual heritage environments (through engagement and education), without having to annoy the user with post-experience questionnaires. However, results suggest interaction in virtual heritage environments is so contextually embedded; subjective post-test questionnaires can still be more reliable than evaluating task performance.</p></div></div></section>

The general failure of virtual environment technology to create engaging and educational experiences may be attributable not just to deficiencies in technology or in visual fidelity, but also to a lack of contextual and engaging interaction, such as that found in games. This is perhaps most important in virtual heritage projects (where virtual reality is used to convey cultural heritage), for cultural heritage necessitates meaningful learning, and interaction appropriate to situated learning. Yet, presentation of virtual heritage projects typically glosses over the interaction used, or the evaluation methods employed. For example, Bowman et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Bowman DA, Kruijff E, LaViola J, Poupyrev I (2005) 3D user interfaces: theory and practice.

They wrote (2005, pp. 363–365):</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body">
                  <p>3D UIs are still often a ‘solution looking for a problem.’ Because of this, the target user population or interaction technique to be evaluated may not be known or well understood…Presence is another example of a measure often required in VE evaluations that has no analogue in traditional UI evaluation.</p>
                </div></blockquote>
              <p>We interpret their phrase ‘solution looking for a problem’ to mean that the technology of 3D user interfaces is often developed without specific aims in mind, so evaluating effectiveness is difficult. With this in mind, we hoped to resolve three questions. Firstly, how do different modes of interaction affect cultural learning in a virtual environment? Secondly, does increased task performance (the ability to complete tasks within a certain time) relate to the cultural understanding achieved? Thirdly, which types of evaluation are most appropriate and accurate in assessing the effectiveness of the interactivity mode on both task performance and understanding?</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec2"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">The test site</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Site selection</h3><p>We chose the Mayan city at Palenque, in Chiapas, Mexico, in order to evaluate how well online digital media can help recreate a sense of cultural inhabitation and communicate the situated culture through interaction. Palenque (or Lakam Ha, which means Big Water in Mayan) is well documented, is where the Mayan language was first decoded by archaeologists and is set in a spectacular landscape. The buildings are generally well preserved, and the Palenque mapping project created an extensive laser-mapped model of the mountainous landscape that sheltered Palenque (Barnhart <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Barnhart E (1998) The Palenque mapping project, 1998 field season report, FAMSI, &#xA;                    http://www.famsi.org/reports/97024/index.html&#xA;                    &#xA;                   [2-15-2007]" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d10328e377">1998</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1999" title="Barnhart E (1999) The Palenque mapping project, 1999 field season report, FAMSI, 1999, &#xA;                    http://www.famsi.org/reports/98063/index.html&#xA;                    &#xA;                   [2-15-2007]" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d10328e380">1999</a>). Despite the impressive condition of the restored buildings, the majority of the artefacts of that city of inscriptions are simply no longer there.</p><p>Palenque was most prominent during the middle of the Classical period of Mayan civilization (300–900 A.D.), and three of its temples hold three tablets to three different gods, as recorded in the Popol Vuh, a Mayan story of creation. Palenque was also the site where archaeologists made a major advance in understanding the complex Mayan written language (Schele and Mathews <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Schele L, Mathews P (1998) The code of kings.

Every year, Mayans visit their sacred temples, dedicate offerings to sacred buildings and commemorate the Day of the Dead, yet tourists may never realize the temples are still being used (Schele and Mathews <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Schele L, Mathews P (1998) The code of kings.

Nor does visiting the sites today ensure that tourists understand how these buildings were used, built or worshipped. For example, tourist guides are often asked where the Mayans have gone. It is true that many Mayan traditions have been infused to some extent with that of the Spanish, and all but a few of their books have been burnt. Yet, it is also true that the majority of Mexicans have native Amerindian blood (Mayan, Aztec, etc.). We suggest a possible way of understanding and appreciating the hidden portals, wells, road signs and constellation maps of the Mayans is to recreate their myths and archaeological remains in digital form.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Previous work on Palenque and Central America</h3><p>Central and South American architecture has featured quite prominently in virtual reconstructions and recreations.

                <p>There was also a project remodelling Palenque in the Unreal game engine by UNAM, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Ruiz et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2004" title="Ruiz R, Weghorst S, Savage J, Oppenheimer P, Furness III T, Dozal Y (2004) Virtual Reality for Archeological Maya cities.

It was designed for specific research purposes and thus was partially completed; one could only run around and inside a temple, and it did not have an accurate landscape model.</p><p>However, there were many pedagogical issues with the above environments. Due to lack of avatars, accurate terrain and other artefacts (such as tools), there was no way of gauging the scale or the spatial relationships of the buildings or even their apparent mass. Online models tend to float in space and do not convey a sense of embodiment. Further, they do not show the rituals and practices and ways in which social roles are regulated by the building in the landscape (Spero <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1994" title="Spero J (1994) Beyond rainstorms: The Kawak as an ancestor, warrior, and patron of witchcraft, originally presented at the seventh Palenque Round Table in 1989.

In the case of Palenque, the specific religious symbolism of the rivers, orientation of buildings (such as the observatory) and sheer visual effect of the buildings nestled against the mountains was missing.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Significant features of Palenque affecting the prototype</h3><p>The Mayans believed in three levels of existence, the sky, the earth and the underworld. Rites involving smoke, sacrificial blood and offerings of food and artefacts were to thank the Gods for continual existence. Some artefacts were seen as magical aids that could help the spirits of the ruling class travel through portals to the other planes of existence (Spero <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1994" title="Spero J (1994) Beyond rainstorms: The Kawak as an ancestor, warrior, and patron of witchcraft, originally presented at the seventh Palenque Round Table in 1989.

So, a way of conveying the magical portals of Mayan myth was required.</p><p>The condition of inscriptions and setting of Palenque, with its mountainous backdrop, wide-span temples, and collection of tablets, tombs and rivers, have made it a popular tourist destination. The early morning fog can be so strong that some archaeologists believe Palenque was created to resemble the Mayan mythical origin of the current world, magical mountains that took form out of the primeval sea (Reilly III <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1989" title="Reilly III, FK (1989) Enclosed ritual spaces and the watery underworld in formative period architecture: New observations on the function of la Venta complex A, originally presented at the Seventh Palenque Round Table in 1989, In: Fields V (ed).

This suggested that the software should be capable of conveying the scale of the external environment and producing adjustable fog.</p><p>Buildings were of extreme importance to the Mayans, they were living sources of energy, and offerings to them appeased the gods, whose support was necessary for the growth of maize, the primary crop (Schele and Mathews <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1998" title="Schele L, Mathews P (1998) The code of kings.

Changing light and shade were used to turn the buildings into astronomical clocks that foretold major events. So in order to demonstrate the function of the religious buildings as astronomical instruments, we required shade and shadow.</p><p>As the Palenque rulers suffered a break in paternal lineage, their temples emphasized the rulers’ right to lead by recording creation myths of the gods and linking them to divine properties of the rulers. As was the tradition with other Mayan cities, Palenque’s buildings were consecrated with human sacrifice (usually war captives); for example, the ball court commemorated both trade and sacrifice, and slaves were found in the burial chambers of the kings (Kremer and Uc <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1996" title="Kremer J, Uc F (1996) The ritual suicide of Maya Rulers, originally presented at the Eighth Palenque Round Table, June 6–12, 1993.

So interaction allowing the user to take part in the sacrificial offering ritual was another requirement. And as the ball court is a recurring theme in Mayan history, we also decided we needed software with physics simulation, so users could actually play the game and thus trigger retellings of the primal myth linking the ball court to the Mayans’ understanding of the birth of the planet and their civilization.</p><p>The three tablets of the major temples, plus the sarcophagus found in the tomb of Hanab Pakal the Great, in the Temple of Inscriptions, stress the relation of heavenly bodies to the ascension of Kings, and to the importance of maize. However, each temple had its own history and foretold different astronomical events. Therefore, we decided to build each major temple and evaluate what sort of interaction was most appropriate to its function.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec6"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec6-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec6">Experimental design</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec6-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Test software</h3><p>Various software was tested, and one product was chosen for the experiment, Adobe Atmosphere. Atmosphere allowed for chat-enabled internet-based three-dimensional worlds. Using JavaScript and a proprietary XML file format, Atmosphere could also import CAD-generated files, and featured Flash-based textures, Windows Media (streaming media), and dynamic scripted effects such as collision, a physics engine, position-based sound, database integration, particles and key events, as well as button-driven interaction. This program could also create native primitives that offered increased frame rate speed and improved dynamic lighting over imported models.</p><p>Various projects have already used Atmosphere for virtual archaeology (Stonehenge, lighthouse of Alexander, Landskrona Cathedral, the Great Pyramid of Cairo, Tikal, and Tenochtitlán). However, most of these environments have been designed as a three-dimensional gallery. They were typically not used with advanced scripting techniques for increased interaction between artefacts, avatars and the environment.</p><p>We built three versions of the site due to the size of the models, and the textures, and because the data had to stream over the Internet. The technology used was Adobe Atmosphere (beta), as it offered accessible scripting and content (XML based), was backed by a large and established software company, was available as a PDF plug-in, could send and pull data from simple web pages, and could be used as multi-player environments shared across the Internet. However, such a decision was premature, as the beta suffered many technical problems, and eventually the product was pulled from the market, just months after version one was released to the world.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8">The test environment</h3><p>Three versions of the site were designed due to the large size of the models, and the textures, and because the software chosen was designed to stream over the Internet. Each version had all the major buildings included, but only the primary building that the visitor was interested in was detailed. It alone contained sculptures and detailed interiors. The other two building areas were three-dimensional but without detailed interiors. Luckily, archaeologists have grouped Palenque into three primary areas.</p><p>Three of the most famous built areas are the Temple of Inscriptions (which also contains an underground tomb with sarcophagus), the Palace (which is really a group of buildings constructed over 200 years over a common substructure) and the Cross Precinct (which contains three similar sized temples, the Temple of the Cross, the Foliated Cross, and the Temple of the Sun, known to archaeologists as the Cross Group).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Structure of experimental design</h3><p>The experiment was to test a possible link between interaction and cultural understanding by modelling and scripting a virtual heritage project with three different types of interactions, activity-based, observational and instruction-based (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig2">2</a>). We will refer to the different types of interaction as ‘interaction modes’, where users are to Observe, be Instructed (by scripted agents, also known as ‘bots’) or Act (manipulate objects in order to accomplish tasks). Ideally, one would have only tested these interaction modes, but the environment was too large for a single model, so the digital model of Palenque was split into three environments.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig2" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 2</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/2" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig2_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-2-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig2_HTML.gif" alt="figure2" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-2-desc"><p>Groups A and B interaction—activity, observation and instruction</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/2" data-track-dest="link:Figure2 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>Briefly, three groups of users (A, B and C) entered three different virtual reconstructions of Palenque, or ‘worlds’ (defined as a virtual environment with a specific type of interactivity). Since there were three virtual environments and three interaction modes, there were a maximum of nine possible archaeological worlds (digital reconstructions of Palenque). Due to logistical and content issues, only six of these worlds were created and used in the experiments.</p><p>Users in the ‘observational’ interaction mode could find information by clicking on objects. The goal was to find all such artefacts and read the related information, within 9 min. The instructional’ interaction mode had clickable objects along with agents (chatbots) that could ask and remember simple dialogue. The task was to gain knowledge through questioning the avatars. The ‘activity’ interaction mode required the participant to move objects out of the way and to navigate the avatar into specific positions in order to be teleported to the next environment.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec10"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec10-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec10">The user experience</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Warm-up environment</h3><p>The participants were eased into the virtual environments, by having a warm-up environment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig3">3</a>) which only required that they move their avatar to read an in-world billboard and then move up the slope of a pyramid to a glowing portal, which transferred them to an online 3D museum of Mayan archaeology. They had 3 min to undertake these tasks, which proved to be sufficient. To avoid confusion, the field of view was set at the default Atmosphere value (although possible to change by script or by user). The users had access to a button they could click on to go home (start position) or to move and orient their avatar’s viewpoint to the next artefact (target).

                <p>In the Palace environment and for the Temple of the Cross Group (three temples), there were dynamic lighting, specific sculptures and three Mayan avatars (two of whom were models of Kings and their traditional costumes). These Mayans acted as hosts and were scaled appropriately (Mayan men were seldom five feet tall, and the women were even shorter.

                <p>The stated goal was to find the other test participant by orientating themselves against large Mayan carvings in the jungle. They were then asked to find the village using the interface guides and the sound of music. Once they approached the correct objects, the music changed, and the objects became visible. They were then asked to find and kick a pot in one of the village huts. If they were using a backpacker avatar, they would have to change to the Mayan avatar in order to be small enough to enter the doorway. This was to remind them of the differences in physical size between the Mayans and modern tourists in relation to the size of the buildings.</p><p>In the Mayan ‘Primal Mountain’ World, (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig9">9</a>) gradually thinning fog was used to convey a mythical setting and just as in the archaeological environments, glare was used at regular intervals to indicate where spiritually valuable artefacts were located.

They were then asked to find any other people (there were two Mayan paddler gods paddling around the mountain).

These included age, gender, experience of three-dimensional digital media, archaeological knowledge, PC game knowledge and travel.</p><p>The control factors, the independent variables, were principally the three virtual environments, and the three ‘modes’ of interactivity, observation, instruction and activity (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab2">2</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Evaluation factors of experimental design</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/2"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>Three types of interactivity, different audience groups and the novelty of the technology necessitated that the experimental objectives were best evaluated by factorial design statistics. Since a variety of evaluation methods were employed, there was also a need for qualitative judgements based on observations of participant responses when part of the design experiment.</p><p>Possible confounding factors included the disparity in sample size, background environmental details (computing power etcetera), speed of the Internet connection and background experience not indicated by the questions. There could also be differences in content complexity between the three environments, or interaction modes may favour (be more suitable for) one environment over another.</p><p>The virtual environments worked in a browser (internet explorer) but to avoid the effects of varying speed, all webpages and the webpage plugin virtual environments were cached locally. All frame rates were automatically recorded by a script every 5 s, so we could compare machines and loading and frame rate across different environments. Two identical machines were used for Group B, and all models etc. loaded via locally, not via the Internet, as mentioned above. Only two machines were used for the twenty-four in Group B, the same two plus eight others with similar technical specifications were used for Group C. Although the computers used for testing were not identical, the tracked frame rates were not significantly different.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Audience groups tested</h3><p>Pilot group evaluations were conducted using a first year archaeology class of forty-nine students (Group A), and for Group B, twenty-four more experienced participants who were either virtual environment designers or cultural historians with an interest in virtual heritage. For Group C, ten IT-experienced people from Lonely Planet Publications (a travel publications company with a strong web-based presence) were tested.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Tasks set in the environments</h3><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab3">3</a> shows the objectives set to each participant for Groups A and B. Once they completed the archaeological world tasks (worlds 1, 2, and 3), they were teleported to the related imaginative worlds (worlds 1a, 2a and 3a), depending on the sequencing of the worlds.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 Palenque tasks for Groups A and B</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/3"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>This pattern was repeated for Group C, except that the interaction modes of worlds 1, 2 and 3 were swapped around so that different interaction in the same environment could be compared across groups.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Sequence of environments</h3><p>Ideally, as mentioned above, there should be nine worlds, but it was found in the design of the environments that not all three modes of interactivity were easily transferable across the three digital environments. While Instruction and Observation modes were easily transferable, Activity mode was ideal for the Temple of Inscriptions, but not for the other two environments. This necessitated an abbreviated factorial design (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab4">4</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-4"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab4" data-test="table-caption">Table 4 Environment Interaction for Groups A, B and C</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/4"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Task performance</h3><p>This measure recorded how often participants managed to click on different information sources. For observation interaction mode, they just had to find the objects, for instruction, they also needed to get advice from the guides, for action, they had to move objects in order to get to the information and click on it. Results were interval data, with a value of 0–6 for each ‘world’ visited. The scores for the imaginative worlds were also recorded but not statistically evaluated, as they did not directly relate to cultural understanding.</p><p>Group B was slightly better at both understanding and task performance on average; compared to Group C. Results were similar between groups except for understanding regards the Palace. With guides the Instruction-Palace for Group C did markedly worse (mean was 1.60) than Observation-Palace for Group B (the mean was 2.67). The only difference was that Group C had guides, but Group B did not. It was completely unexpected that adding guides to a virtual environment would actually impede task performance, as the guides made location of the task more obvious.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec28">Cultural understanding</h3><p>This measure was recorded from a post-experience questionnaire of eighteen questions (listed above). It is based on the participants’ ability to select the right answer, displaying their recall ability, and ability to extrapolate likely Mayan beliefs and facts. Results were discrete data with a value of 0–18. The data were labelled cultural understanding (understanding in the tables) and were discussed in the previous section. As noted in that section, Group A extrapolated knowledge was not recorded, due to incomplete results, hardware difficulties and the participants (students) not completing each virtual environment and interaction mode.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29">Performance and understanding</h3><p>In the design experiment, relating task performance to cultural understanding, the questionnaire recorded cultural understanding through testing what participants remembered, as well as what they were able to recall and extrapolate from web pages that popped up when well-hidden artefacts were clicked. Unfortunately, cultural understanding did not appear to relate closely to task performance for either Group B or Group C. The Cross Precinct environment was almost perfectly scored for task performance, yet in terms of understanding, it was second overall for Group B and just in front of Inscriptions for Group C understanding (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab7">7</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-10"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab7" data-test="table-caption">Table 7 Groups B and C performance and understanding</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/10"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>Participants in Groups B and C solved the least number of tasks in the Palace environment, but answered more questions correctly there. They solved all the tasks in the Cross environment, but it ranked second on correctly answered questions. The Inscriptions environment ranked second for task performance and last for correct number of answers. While task performance decreased with age, the rate of correct answers (cultural understanding) increased with age (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab8">8</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-11"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab8" data-test="table-caption">Table 8 Group B age group and understanding</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/11"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>There are two possible reasons for this, the questions in the Inscriptions environment were harder than in the other two, or the environments themselves confounded the results. Having checked the questions with an archaeology teacher, probably the problem was with the different types of environment, and the presence survey appears to substantiate this.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">Demographic effects on understanding</h3><p>Where demographic data (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab8">8</a>) are recorded and considered the independent variable, we found a close to significant correlation between age and cultural understanding (Pearson correlation <i>r</i> = 0.367, <i>p</i> = 0.072) and between PC game experience and understanding (Pearson correlation <i>r</i> = 0.337, <i>p</i> = 0.107).</p><p>There were some interesting variations based on demographics and life experience for both Groups B and C. For Group B, there was a nearly significant relation of age to understanding, and a nearly significant negative relation of travel experience to task performance. There was a significant relationship between game experience and age, and between game experience and an ability to discern correct frame rate. What this meant was that the younger participants typically had more gaming experience (which was to be expected), and that those with more gaming experience were more accurate in estimating which environments had faster or slower frame rates.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Presence rankings</h3><p>Reviewing the presence rankings of archaeological worlds for Groups A, B and C is revealing (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab9">9</a>). For all three, the Palace environment was most interesting. For Group B, the Action-Inscriptions world was the most interesting and most interactive world (for Group A, it was Observation-Palace).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-12"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab9" data-test="table-caption">Table 9 Groups A, B and C top-ranked worlds</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/tables/12"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>Environment rather than interaction appears to be a strong factor in generating the feeling one is in the presence of Mayan culture, is probably a factor in what makes the world more or less interesting, and may be a factor in generating a feeling that it is closest to the Mayan perspective.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec32">Presence and game-style interaction</h3><p>Groups B and C experienced the same game-style interactive worlds. If we collate the presence rankings per hand-eye coordination style worlds (Ballcourt and Cave) and per observation worlds (Village and Mountain) and tabulate them against an average presence ranking of the three archaeological worlds, we get the following results (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig14">14</a>). Despite different interaction modes between Group B and Group C for the Archaeological worlds, their presence rankings are very similar. However, the small number of Group C participants and the similarity of the other rankings between the two groups suggest that further statistical analysis is not meaningful. However, the overall similarity in rankings between the two groups is promising.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-14"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig14" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 14</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/14" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig14_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-14-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig14_HTML.gif" alt="figure14" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-14-desc"><p>Graph of hand-eye versus observation-based environments</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/14" data-track-dest="link:Figure14 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>Also, the hand-eye games are considered much more interactive in both groups than the observation ones. This is interesting, there was not much more actual scripted interaction in the hand-eye environments, but there was more interaction the participant could immediately control. It is possible that interactive agency rather than the amount of overall actual scripted interactivity in the virtual environment is of strong importance to the user.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec33">Groups B and C correlation of questions</h3><p>For Groups B and C (<i>n</i> = 34), we could calculate how close answers are between the different Presence questions and found a correlation or 0.86 (<i>p</i> = 0.03) between ‘Which felt most like you were in the presence of Mayan culture?’ and ‘Which did you feel most closely represented the way Mayans saw their own world?’</p><p>Using the same approach (combining Groups B and C, so <i>N</i> = 34), to see which pairs of answers to the below questions had a significantly negative correlation, we find two pairs of near significance and slight significance (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Tab10">10</a>).

It uncovered a potential new factor for consideration by future researchers and that is cognitive overloading (including too many interactive processes for the participant to cope with effectively while immersed within a virtual environment).</p><p>Staggering the sequence of worlds visited by the participants proved to be important. There was a clearly lower average task performance and understanding score for the first world experienced compared to the next two. Environmental recall was significant for gauging heights of other avatars, in relation to cultural understanding.</p><p>For B and C treated as a combined group, there was also a relationship between gender, task performance and cultural understanding, but there were not enough women to make a strong conclusion based on the data. The statistical results suggest a gaming background does influence the cultural understanding score, and to some extent, task performance. For example, gender had a much greater influence than expected, but a future experiment would need a larger sample size to make any major claims. A more even spread of demographic factors and comparable sample sizes of equal distribution between genders should be attempted in future evaluations.</p><p>The findings suggest that engagement relates to how appropriate the interactivity is to the environment rather than what type of interactivity it is. Any apparently small variances in environmental content may strongly affect results. Therefore, the environment that people are experiencing is an important factor.</p><p>Although the interaction modes used in the experimental design were non-violent and non-destructive, the results indicated the least interactive mode (Observation) was the most successful (ranked first and second) for ‘most interesting’ world.</p><p>In short, despite an initial hypothesis that the environmental content should not drastically affect the results, the environment seems to be a far stronger factor than does interaction mode, for most of the presence responses. This does not necessarily mean we cannot aim for richer and more distinctive and involved interaction modes, but they must be appropriate to the environment, believable, and yet not interfere with the cognitive demands of cultural learning in virtual environments.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec37">Design implications</h3><p>Three major design-related issues appeared to confound results especially in the Cross Precinct Environment. These were cognitive loading, navigation and compelling and believable social agents.</p><p>Navigation must be consistent to obtain results. Oman et al. (<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2003" title="Oman C, Howard I, Smith T, Beall A, Natapoff A, Zacher J, Jenkin H (2003) The role of visual cues in microgravity spatial orientation. In: Buckey J, Homick J (eds) Eurolab spacelab mission: Neuroscience research in space: Results from the STS-90. Neurolab Spacelab Mission, NASA, Houston, pp 69–81" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#ref-CR9" id="ref-link-section-d10328e4375">2003</a>) noted that participants in virtual worlds do not tend to rotate as much as in the real world, and that this may make navigational cues all the more important. Such research seems to substantiate the inference that the Cross Temple Environment was considered not at all challenging because on entry to the world every task can be seen within the screen at the same time (that is, all three temples and tablets). The navigational and orientation features of environments have to be clear perceived affordances to the end user if we are to compare task performance across environments. Creating believable agents was a problem.</p><p>While people are attracted to scripted agents (who act as guides), they soon tire of them if they can predict their behaviour. There also appeared to be cognitive overloading when using scripted agents and the agents did not appear to be believable enough. However, they were good navigation landmarks as the participants all saw them very quickly (the scripted agents’ default behaviour involved some movement from side to side).</p><p>If redeveloped, only one large part of the site should have been chosen, and quite distinct interactive modes applied to it. The desire to show people archaeological content of the entire site was compelling, but in the end analysis, the point was to build an experimental context, not an educational showcase.</p><p>The second redesign issue would be to redress the (unexpected) ease of task completion in the Cross Precinct environment. Tasks for that environment should have been extended or made more difficult to complete.</p><p>Thirdly, there was a designer fallacy or bias in attempting to use dynamic lighting as only half the participants noticed it. While dynamic lighting (real-time shadows) may indeed make the virtual world seem more immersive, since it is not obvious to others and decreases frame rate significantly it should have been dropped. Designers may want to convey atmosphere, but in a game-style task-based environment, the end-users want interactive control and low levels of latency (i.e. minimal lag).</p><p>Another example of designer bias was in the designer versus end user perception of ‘most interesting’ and ‘most interactive’ world. The most interactive (i.e. heavily scripted) world was the Cave, but this was not picked up on by many participants in their answers to the related presence question.</p><p>Also, when adding game-style interaction to virtual environments, participants may miss important educational features of the environment as they are concentrating on solving specific tasks. For example, none of the users in the above game-style environment realized that the mountain they walked on and around was actually a giant caiman (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig15">15</a>).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-15"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig15" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 15</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/15" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig15_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-15-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig15_HTML.gif" alt="figure15" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-15-desc"><p>Caiman/Crocodile outline of Primal Mountain, rowers in distance</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/15" data-track-dest="link:Figure15 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec38">Evaluating evaluation methods for virtual heritage</h3><p>The results suggested that the answers to the present questionnaire were highly subjective. For while all groups according to the presence of factor rankings generally found the archaeological worlds to be more authentic and interesting than the imaginative worlds, the evaluator found it much harder to drag them out of the latter.</p><p>For example, the artefacts and themes in the imaginative worlds were also based on archaeological records and anthropological theories of the cultural and mythical beliefs of the Mayans. The Ballcourt was based on a direct reconstruction of the Palenque Ballcourt from photos (we did not have full measurements for this building). Yet, people consistently rated the imaginative worlds lower for both ‘most interesting world’, and for the ‘cultural presence’ questions. Not all imaginative worlds were navigationally as challenging as the archaeological worlds, but they were generally smaller and more confined. This may be another reason they failed to rank well against the archaeological worlds.</p><p>The students (Group A) in particular were keen to explore all the capabilities of the avatars rather than the archaeological modelling they were meant to be interested in. Some wished to know what parts of the environment and others they could find and destroy. So it is possible that as virtual heritage projects attempt to improve graphic performance and engagement (and by extension, usability and usefulness), by adopting conventional game-style interaction and design, the more genre-trapped they may become, persuading the student to see them only as a game, and a destructive one at that. However, the results above indicate that even many practitioners as well as the majority of students are keen to explore the more imaginative versions of virtual heritage sites. The challenge is to make the interaction both educational and replete with the ‘hard fun’ element of engaging games.</p><p>In other words, experienced gamers concentrated on solving tasks rather than exploring the environment for its own sake, and the more authentic environments were actually considered less authentic the more they afforded interaction. Hence, to simply add interaction to a virtual environment does not necessarily make it more authentic, and adding game-style scenarios appears to help users know what to expect in a virtual environment, but they seem to take it less seriously the more they can affect it.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec39">Ongoing-related work</h3><p>In 2005, the first author organized a student project where the model was ported to a game engine (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0#Fig16">16</a>). The students built a special environment where the game was projected onto three walls and a ceiling, roughly 2.4 ms. People could navigate with a 3D joystick; their task was to find the Mayan version of the underworld (Xibalba). A shaman stick allowed them to control lightning, and if they found the Ballcourt, the Ballcourt split open and they were sent to Xibalba (modelled on the description in the Mayan book, The Popol Vuh). When people are surrounded by a large game space in three dimensions that is bigger than they are, and when they interact by standing and moving (we used sensor pads), the scale of the place and the embodiment of the visitor begins to develop into an entirely new perspective.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-16"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig16" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 16</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/16" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig16_HTML.jpg?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-16-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10055-011-0191-0/MediaObjects/10055_2011_191_Fig16_HTML.jpg" alt="figure16" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-16-desc"><p>Palenque in the Unreal Engine</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/article/10.1007/s10055-011-0191-0/figures/16" data-track-dest="link:Figure16 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
                <p>The game engine allowed quick and easy use of current models (including avatars and flying birds), was significantly quicker and could be used to project via several cameras at once (it has been used to run in a CAVE). Despite being used for many peripherals, we did find coding to be laborious, and it is not immediately cross-platform. Future work will hopefully examine the model in more recent and thus more advanced game engines that can afford more social participation and interaction with the model without sacrificing speed or resolution quality. The primary author has also developed more advanced and thematically appropriate interaction genres and hopes to test them and publish them at a later date.</p></div></div></section>
