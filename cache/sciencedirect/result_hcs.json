Back projection technology tends to have certain advantages over head mounted displays including less simulation sickness and less restricted user movement. A prototype was built to evaluate the usefulness of projection technology VEs and interaction techniques for astronaut training. This was achieved by first constructing a PC cluster-based general purpose VE software and hardware platform. This platform was used to implement a testing prototype for astronaut assembly sequence training. An interaction tool battery was designed for the purposes of viewpoint control and object handling. A selected training task was implemented as a case study for further analysis based on laptop usage in the Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) inside the Columbus module in the International Space Station (ISS). User tests were conducted on the usability of the prototype for the intended training purpose.

Touch is a powerful conduit for emotional connectedness, and thus mediating haptic (touch) displays have been proposed to address this deficiency; but suitable evaluative methodology has been elusive. In this paper, we offer a first, structured examination of a design space for haptic support of remote affective communication, by analyzing the space and then comparing haptic models designed to manipulate its key dimensions. In our study, dyads (intimate pairs or strangers) are asked to communicate specified emotions using a purely haptic link that consists of virtual models rendered on simple knobs. These models instantiate both interaction metaphors of varying intimacy, and representations of virtual interpersonal distance. Our integrated objective and subjective observations imply that emotion can indeed be communicated through this medium, and confirm that the factors examined influence emotion communication performance as well as preference, comfort and connectedness. The proposed design space and the study results have implications for future efforts to support affective communication using the haptic modality, and the study approach comprises a first model for systematic evaluation of haptically expressed affect.", "keywords": [""], "published_in": "International Journal of Human-Computer Studies", "publication_date": "2007/04/01", "citations": "", "isbn": "", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.11.006", "pdf_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581906001911/pdfft", "paper_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581906001911"}, {"title": "", "authors": [], "abstract": "", "keywords": [""], "published_in": "International Journal of Human-Computer Studies", "publication_date": "2016/03/01", "citations": "", "isbn": "", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2015.10.006", "pdf_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581915001743/pdfft", "paper_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581915001743"}, {"title": "Presence, memory and interaction in virtual environments", "authors": ["Alistairsutcliffe", "Briangault", "Jae-Eunshin"], "abstract": "An experimental study is described, comparing presence, memory, and interaction in three different virtual environments: CAVE, Interactive WorkBench, and Reality Room.

Even in virtual environments we tend to interact in a social way. Our research addresses the tasks of recognition, interpretation, and visualization of affect communicated through text messaging. In order to facilitate sensitive and expressive interaction in computer-mediated communication, we previously introduced a novel syntactical rule-based approach to affect recognition from text. The evaluation of the developed Affect Analysis Model showed promising results regarding its capability to accurately recognize affective information in text from an existing corpus of informal online conversations. To enrich the user&#x27;s experience in online communication, to make it enjoyable, exciting, and fun, we implemented a web-based Instant Messaging (IM) application, AffectIM, and endowed it with emotional intelligence by integrating the developed Affect Analysis Model. This paper describes the findings of a twenty-person study conducted with our AffectIM system.

In the blogosphere, many communities have emerged, which include hate groups and racists that are trying to share their ideology, express their views, or recruit new group members. It is important to analyze these virtual communities, defined based on membership and subscription linkages, in order to monitor for activities that are potentially harmful to society. While many Web mining and network analysis techniques have been used to analyze the content and structure of the Web sites of hate groups on the Internet, these techniques have not been applied to the study of hate groups in blogs. To address this issue, we have proposed a semi-automated approach in this research. The proposed approach consists of four modules, namely blog spider, information extraction, network analysis, and visualization. We applied this approach to identify and analyze a selected set of 28 anti-Blacks hate groups (820 bloggers) on Xanga, one of the most popular blog hosting sites. Our analysis results revealed some interesting demographical and topological characteristics in these groups, and identified at least two large communities on top of the smaller ones.
