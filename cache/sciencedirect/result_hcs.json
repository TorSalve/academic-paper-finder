This paper considers Terror Management Theory (TMT), one of the notable theories that have not been considered so far in persuasive technology, and aims at exploring its use in VR experiences. First, we show that a VR experience can be used to effectively elicit mortality salience (MS), which makes TMT applicable. Then, we evaluate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), participants explored one of two virtual environments (VEs). In a first group of participants, the VE represented a cemetery with MS cues like tombs and burial recesses. In a second group of participants, the MS cues were removed, and the VE looked like a public park. Results show that the MS cues manipulation changed the effects of the VR experience on users\u2019 attitudes towards risk, as TMT would predict. Moreover, results revealed a relationship between MS elicited through VR and physiological correlates of arousal. Finally, we show that user&#x27;s personality traits can moderate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk.", "keywords": [""], "published_in": "International Journal of Human-Computer Studies", "publication_date": "2017/05/01", "citations": "", "isbn": "", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.01.002", "pdf_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581917300022/pdfft", "paper_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581917300022"}, {"title": "Study on interaction-induced symptoms with respect to virtual grasping and manipulation", "authors": [], "abstract": "Owing to the popularity of various hand tracking interfaces, there have been numerous applications developed to provide intuitive hand interaction with the virtual world.

Although the task itself is rather trivial in a real life situation, it requires much effort in the virtual environment. We address this awkwardness as \u2018VR interaction-induced fatigue symptom\u2019 and hypothesize its causes based on our observations. We argue that the source of the fatigue comes from the restricted sensory information of the VR interfaces, and that users try to accommodate the missing sensory feedback by excessive motion leading to wrong posture or bad timing. We demonstrate our hypothesis by conducting experiments of two types of virtual interaction scenarios: object transport and 3D selection.

An emerging approach is gaze modulated pointing, which enables users to perform object selection and manipulation in a virtual space conveniently through the use of a combination of gaze and other interaction techniques (e.g., mid-air gestures). As gaze modulated pointing uses different sensors to track and detect user behaviours, its performance relies on the user&#x27;s perception on the exact spatial mapping between the virtual space and the physical space. An underexplored issue is, when the spatial mapping differs with the user&#x27;s perception, manipulation errors (e.g., out of boundary errors, proximity errors) may occur. Therefore, in gaze modulated pointing, as gaze can introduce misalignment of the spatial mapping, it may lead to user&#x27;s misperception of the virtual environment and consequently manipulation errors. This paper provides a clear definition of the problem through a thorough investigation on its causes and specifies the conditions when it occurs, which is further validated in the experiment. It also proposes three methods (Scaling, Magnet and Dual-gaze) to address the problem and examines them using a comparative study which involves 20 participants with 1040 runs. The results show that all three methods improved the manipulation performance with regard to the defined problem where Magnet and Dual-gaze delivered better performance than Scaling.

We have conducted controlled experiments in which users operated a pen input device to steer a virtual ball through paths of varying length, width, curvature and orientation.

The problem occurs when grasping techniques require fingers to be moved outside an object&#x27;s boundaries after a user&#x27;s (real) fingers interpenetrate virtual objects due to a lack of physical motion constraints. This may be especially distracting for grasp techniques that introduce mismatches between tracked and visual hand configurations to visually prevent interpenetration. Our method includes heuristic analysis of finger motion and a transient incremental motion metaphor to manage a virtual hand during grasp release. We integrate the method into a spring model for whole-hand virtual grasping to maintain the physically-based pickup and manipulation behavior of such models. We show that the new spring model improves release speed and accuracy based on pick-and-drop, targeted ball-drop, and cube-alignment experiments. In contrast to a standard spring-based grasping method, measured release quality does not depend notably on object size. Users subjectively prefer the new approach and it can be tuned to avoid potential side effects such as increased drops or visual distractions.

Synthetic agents serving as companions should respond similarly. However, empathetic reasoning is riddled with the complexities stemming from the myriad factors bearing upon situational assessment. A key challenge posed by affective reasoning in synthetic agents is devising empirically informed models of empathy that accurately respond in social situations. This paper presents Care, a data-driven affective architecture and methodology for learning models of empathy by observing human\u2013human social interactions. First, in Care training sessions, one trainer directs synthetic agents to perform a sequence of tasks while another trainer manipulates companion agents\u2019 affective states to produce empathetic behaviors (spoken language, gesture, and posture). Care tracks situational data including locational, intentional, and temporal information to induce a model of empathy. At runtime, Care uses the model of empathy to drive situation-appropriate empathetic behaviors. Care has been used in a virtual environment testbed.
